Russia &amp; Iran have long cooperated on issues of common interest. In July, Putin visited Iran, &amp; the 2 countries vowed to strengthen and expand their nefarious relationship, incl. by leveraging Iran's sanctions evasion techniques to assist Russia's economy. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1549091756100165632">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">Putin visits Iran for first trip outside former U.S.S.R. since Ukraine war (Putin visits Iran for first trip outside former U.S.S.R. since Ukraine war... | reut.rs) (Link to twitter.com)</span></a> Cooperation w/Iran has also paid serious dividends for Russia's war in Ukraine. Russia has reportedly received its first drones from Iran. Iranian UAV's have targeted US forces and partners across the Mid East &amp; may prove to be devastating in Ukraine. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/POLITICOEurope/status/1564621665212026882">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">The first shipment of what US officials assess will be hundreds of Iranian unmanned aerial vehicles has arrived in Russia, according to a Pentagon spokesperson.

Moreover, Iran shipped 25,000 pounds of low-enriched uranium to Russia in order to comply with the JCPOA in 2015. The US recently said it wouldn't sanction Russian participation in these projects &amp; would again consider Russia accepting Iran's excess enriched uranium under a revived JCPOA. These discussions are happening as Russian shelling threatens Europe's largest nuclear plant in Ukraine. Finally, we must consider how a revived JCPOA can undermine our sanctions against Russia by giving Russia the opportunity to sell its oil through Iran. It's essential that our policy towards Russia and Iran are coordinated &amp; aligned to advance US interests.<a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/POLITICOEurope/status/1563776321599246336">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">Vladimir Putin has a perfectly timed Plan B to get sanctioned Russian oil out to global markets: Iran.

As we continue to stand strongly with Ukraine, the JCPOA simply cannot be viewed independent of its likely benefits to Russia and Russia's ongoing war against Ukraine.</em>”</p>

Iran must be held accountable for its role as the largest state sponsor of terrorism &amp; malign activities in the region – particularly given the current political instability in Iraq. 7/8 As the negotiations move forward, it is critical that Congress be kept fully apprised, which is why I've requested a full briefing from the White House.
