An idea gets rolling, develops uncontrollable momentum, and then, before anyone has really evaluated the idea's merit, it's knocking over everything.  1/ This could be happening today on Taiwan policy. Let me explain: 2/ For decades, the U.S. has helped secure peace on the island of Taiwan, largely bc of a policy through which we a) neither recognize Taiwan's independence nor recognize China's claim to Taiwan; and b) help Taiwan defend itself without explicitly guaranteeing their security. 3/ Our policy is purposely fuzzy. And it has worked.  But now, things are changing. China is getting more aggressive. Undermining and isolating Taiwan. Building up its military. Flexing left and right. Hinting at an invasion in the near future. 4/ In this context, our Taiwan policy MUST change. We need to expedite and increase arms sales. We should help Taiwan join international bodies. We should sanction Chinese officials who undermine Taiwan. We should fight Chinese anti-Taiwan propaganda. 5/ But many in Congress and the think tank ecosystem argue that the U.S. must go much further - by ending "strategic ambiguity", recognizing Taiwan, and promising to fully defend Taiwan if China invades. A full reversal of decades of bipartisan consensus on Taiwan policy. 6/ It's a policy that looks strong and tough on China, but does it actually protect our interests? The answer is no. Recognizing Taiwan doesn't actually protect Taiwan; it will just enrage our allies and possibly provoke China into retaliation and a quicker invasion. 7/ Further, there's no need for an explicit defense guarantee. China has already priced in a full U.S. defense if they invade, so what do we get by making Taiwan's defense our explicit policy? Again, it's tough talk without enough upside to counter the provocatory downside. 8/ It's fair to counter that we shouldn't make policy based on China's irrational hurt feelings. Okay, but our China portfolio isn't just Taiwan. It's trade, human rights, NKorea, climate, fentanyl, etc. Shouldn't we consider how Taiwan policy changes affect the whole portfolio? 9/ Bowling balls are hard to stop. We've seen it over and over - Vietnam, Iraq, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span> etc. Leaders often don't want to look "weak" by questioning paths to conflict.   But here, we can step up efforts to protect Taiwan, without totally throwing out decades of successful policy.</em>”</p>

We got them to the safety of Albania, a country that was extraordinarily generous to offer them safe harbor. 1/ 2/ @SpiritAmerica, an incredible organization, cared for their needs and were wonderful partners for my office in this chapter. But while the Afghans were safe, this chapter was, in many ways, the hardest part of the story, because of the incredible limbo they lived with. 3/ They were not going to settle in Albania permanently, and had to work their way through a lengthy and uncertain process for the U.S. They lived in fear of being sent back to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/11/30/afghans-msu-ties-limbo-albania-fearful-being-forgotten/8768781002/">Afghans with ties to MSU wait in limbo in Albania, fearful of being forgotten... | detroitnews.com</a> 4/ We organized Zoom calls with the families to keep in touch &amp; give them any updates I had about State Department processing, though everyone knew that they were overwhelmed with 80,000 Afghans who had just come out at the same time. 5/ In November 2021, I organized a bipartisan congressional delegation with some of my colleagues to visit Albania, thank the officials I'd been working with, and to finally meet the Afghan families for myself. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1565342664895016962/photo/1">Link to image</a> 6/ They, along with some additional Afghans, were living in a moderate seaside resort on the Adriatic. It's no exaggeration to say that this was one of the most moving experiences of my career. 7/ After @SenJoniErnst and I had lunch and hosted a roundtable with the Afghans, I held a private meeting with the 114 who I felt personally responsible for. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1565342674617774088/photo/1">Link to image</a> 8/ They were exhausted from having to flee their home country and desperately worried about family they left behind, but they also felt a deep uncertainly about what would happen to them. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1565342682733457408/photo/1">Link to image</a> 9/ They were raw with emotion, tears, and a desperation for their children's future. Our translator even had to swap out because he, too, couldn't contain his emotions. 10/ They asked me — begged me — not to forget them. I remember the lump in my throat as grown men and women begged for their children's lives and the opportunity to continue contributing in the United States. Anywho who has been or has met a refugee knows that desperation. 11/ What I told them was this: I could not &amp; would not forget them, because I saw in each of them the faces of my grandparents &amp; great-grandparents who also left their home countries for safety, security &amp; a better chance at life. And now, their grandchild is a congresswoman. 12/ As I left Albania, I told them that I'd do everything I could to get them to the U.S., and then there'd be no limits on what they and their children could achieve. 13/ Upon our return, Sen. Ernst &amp; I collaborated on a bipartisan, bicameral letter to the administration, urging that Afghans who had helped the U.S. and happened to get to a third country be vetted and treated the same as the other Afghans who got on a military plane. 14/ In December 2021, I met with senior White House officials who - along with @SecMayorkas, Deputy Secretary Tien and State Department staff - agreed to arrange for thorough security &amp; health vetting of the Afghans in Albania &amp; some in other third countries as well. 15/ The Afghans that had helped U.S. efforts in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> were finally, in early 2022, being vetted to come in with Temporary Protected Status. But that's the next and final chapter - coming to the United States. More on that soon.</em>”</p>
