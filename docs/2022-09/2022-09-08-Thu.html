And that is true for any party. Let us choose our own candidates to put up against Republicans in each November election – without outside interference! And let us live up to our values. How can we criticize Citizens United and pass bill after bill in the House to ban dark and unaccountable money from politics but then allow it in our own primary elections with the excuse that its legally allowable because of bad Supreme Court decisions? No one is calling for unilateral disarmament in general elections! All folks are saying is that corporations and wealthy individuals should not be able to put their thumbs on the scales in Dem primaries. And if anyone thinks this is all about <span class="MOTR_Keyword">AIPAC</span>, you know Big Oil, Big Pharma, the gun industry and other groups are watching and lining up to pick their favored nominees from *both* parties. It's a can't lose proposition for them! Finally, this resolution can be implemented with real effect.
