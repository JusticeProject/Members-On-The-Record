These are our neighbors. Our friends. Our children. The US must ensure that these Americans &amp; their families remain a priority and are placed at the center of our foreign policy &amp; diplomatic agenda. We have a moral obligation to bring every American wrongfully held abroad home. This includes Iran. We must ensure the regime doesn't receive even $1 from a nuclear agreement while Americans remain wrongfully held in Iran. I'm glad @POTUS met with the Griner &amp; Whelan families today - he should meet w/every family of an American hostage or wrongful detainee. Passing the Levinson Act has been one of my proudest moments in Congress. The US must build on this &amp; create a long-term strategy to prevent and deter the taking of hostages &amp; wrongful detainees, incl. imposing financial costs on countries that engage in this egregious practice.</em>”</p>
