My staff &amp; I felt a responsibility to make sure they arrived safely in the U.S. after everything they had sacrificed on behalf of our country &amp; our mission in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. 4/ So when we finally heard the date they'd be arriving, I knew we had to be there as they stepped off the plane to start this new chapter. In late March, I joined a few of my staffers, a group from @SpiritAmerica &amp; staff from the @michiganstateu GRAIN program to do just that. 5/ They were some of the first Afghans who'd been evacuated to other countries to land in the U.S. As I hugged them as they stepped off the plane, it was hard not to think that they were going through the same experiences my own ancestors did at Ellis Island not so long ago. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1567209638143172612/photo/1">Link to image</a> 6/ The effort to get these folks through the streets of Kabul, into the airport, onto a flight to safety and, finally, to the U.S., was a long, emotional &amp; tumultuous saga. To see them snake through the lines at Dulles to be processed for their new visa status was overwhelming. 7/ As I told my team that morning, it's not every day that you get to see something all the way through in government work. And it's not every day that you get to greet the people on the receiving end of that work. 8/ Today, these men &amp; women have spread out all over the U.S., including some who are now in Michigan. As an American whose ancestors left their home countries seeking a better life, I know that there's no telling what these resilient people will do with this opportunity.</em>”</p>
