"COVID-19 and unprecedented droughts have already strained global food supply chains.  Now, Putin's unprovoked and full-scale invasion of Ukraine is another nail in the coffin. Globally, 50 million people across 45 countries are on the brink of famine. "In Somalia, we are days away from an official famine declaration. Today, over 300,000 children are facing emergency starvation. Amidst this global crisis, we cannot lose focus on longer term investments in food security and agricultural-led economic growth. "Ultimately, this bill builds the capacities of families and communities to provide for themselves. Combatting the global food crisis must be a priority for Congress and this administration. Now is not the time to risk allowing key authorities to expire. "I am also pleased to support my friend @RepSires' bill directing the State Department to support a two-year extension of the international Fact-Finding Mission on Venezuela. "Since it was established in 2019, the mission has uncovered that systemic crimes against humanity are being committed by the Maduro regime. "The mission was also the first independent organization that found the Venezuelan regime was wrongfully detaining foreign nationals to extract concessions, including Americans. "Right now, at least 11 Americans are being wrongfully detained by the criminal Maduro regime, some of whom are my constituents. I take my obligation to these Americans seriously and implore the State Department to work with Congress to get them home. "Lastly, I'm a cosponsor of Mr. Sherman's Peace and Tolerance in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Palestinian</span> Education Act and thank him for his work on this issue."</em>”</p>
