While we only account for 5 percent of the world's population, we use 80 percent of the world's opioid painkillers. Like most states, Missouri has been tragically impacted by the opioid epidemic.  In our state, drug overdoses have become the #1 leading cause of death among adults aged 18 to 44 years old, with 70 percent of these deaths involving opioids. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepHartzler/status/1575864995732418560/photo/1">Link to image</a> These numbers seem grim, but there is hope.  Thanks to resources from faith-based community groups, dedicated organizations, and state and federal government programs, our nation has seen many success stories with Missourians battling substance abuse. Earlier this year, I visited Lane Change in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Lebanon</span>, MO which helps families receive counseling and inpatient treatment for substance abuse.  Lauren Mitchell has spent the last three years transforming many lives through education, outreach, prevention, and prayer. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepHartzler/status/1575865002959212544/photo/1">Link to image</a> I also visited Primrose Hill in Clark, MO. This is a residential recovery center for women with or without children who are coming out of drug and alcohol addictions. This Missouri organization has proven to be a recovery center like no other, serving fifteen women in 2021 alone. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepHartzler/status/1575865008071720960/photo/1">Link to image</a> Back in March, I spent time at The Embassy, Inc., a program for young men coping with life-controlling issues such as drug dependency.  Jason McClain, Rick Rogers, and their team at The Embassy have done such great work in their community. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepHartzler/status/1575865013541441538/photo/1">Link to image</a> These organizations in our district are just a few of the many groups of Missourians going above and beyond for individuals suffering from substance abuse and addiction to restore lives and give hope. I know that there is help beyond addiction.  People can chart a new path and recover.  I hope these stories and resources will enable more celebrations of recovery next year.</em>”</p>
