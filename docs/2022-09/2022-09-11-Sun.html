DHS continues to deny there is a problem, even as the FBI is investigating evacuees paroled into our country that have been flagged as potential threats to our national security. Last October, I raised concerns after committee oversight of the vetting operations identified many of these issues. I called for the admin to address the lack of appropriate screening &amp; vetting. As I have said repeatedly, I support the resettlement of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span>s who stood in battle with us and our allies over the last 20 years but we must ensure our national security through thorough vetting.</em>‚Äù</p>

As we commit to never forget, let's also remember that <span class="MOTR_Keyword">terror</span>ism has no home in any religious tradition... and that opposing <span class="MOTR_Keyword">terror</span>ism is a collective responsibility. To the 1st point - remember George W Bush: "The face of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">terror</span>ism not the true faith of Islam... Islam is peace... When we think of Islam, we think of a faith that brings comfort to a billion people around the world... and that's made brothers and sisters out of every race" And to the 2nd, remember the 33 passengers and 7 crew members, who barely knew each other but mobilized as one to thwart a <span class="MOTR_Keyword">terror</span>ist attack on the US Capitol.  They sacrificed everything so that we wouldn't have to. Those two vignettes in no way diminish the losses at the Pentagon, at the World Trade Center, or of our soldiers who gave everything in the fighting that followed.  But as we mourn a day that felt like America at it's worst, let's not forget to celebrate America at it's best. In the days and years after 9/11, the initial tolerance gave way to anti-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Muslim</span> backlash. And the idea that we would come together to thwart a <span class="MOTR_Keyword">terror</span>ist attack on the US Capitol feels uncomfortably quaint in 2022. But in the immediacy of the day, our initial instincts were right. We focused on that which united us, not that which divided.  We put the preservation of our democracy over all else.  It is that instinct which makes us great.  Hold on to it.  Lead with Love.  And never forget. /fin</em>‚Äù</p>
