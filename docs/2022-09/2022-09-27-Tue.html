You are not special. But what is special about what you did is that instead of calling law enforcement (which as Attorney General you have access to), you sent your wife to get the car. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/kenpaxtontx/status/1574608678854205440">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@TexasTribune It's clear that the media wants to drum up another controversy involving my work as Attorney General, so they're attacking me for having the audacity to avoid a stranger lingering outside my home and showing concern about the safety and well-being of my family.</span></a> &nbsp; <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1574646372640649216">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@tedlieu @KenPaxtonTX Big pharma and military industrial complex salesman talks to another person about honor.</span></a> @mommysnewsskirt @KenPaxtonTX I don't sell pharmaceuticals or military equipment.

The person who did that is called Vladimir Putin.
