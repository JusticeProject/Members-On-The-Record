In the toughest races in the country.  So much for the Red Wave. Our mandate is clear: American voters rejected cynical loud-voiced extremists. It's time for a new generation of service-shaped leaders like @serve_america-endorsed @LaurenUnderwood, @SpanbergerVA07, @ChrisForPA, and @PatRyanUC. Look, I served 4 tours in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span>. I'm not afraid of bipartisanship; in fact, I rely on it to get the job done. I passed the #988Lifeline by working with a Republican colleague under the Trump administration because we share a commitment to improving mental health. The time is now for leaders whose national service taught them how to come together to get things done. I will work with anyone who in good faith is committed to making our country better. #Midterms2022</em>‚Äù</p>
