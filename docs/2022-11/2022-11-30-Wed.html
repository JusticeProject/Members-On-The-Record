That's apparently the standard for when political speech must be banned. No generalizable criteria that could be impartially enforced -- just one Congressman's personal whim</span></a> @mtracey Is a rule against Antisemitism not sufficiently generalizable to you?   Do you even acknowledge that the comments of Kanye West and Nick Fuentes are Antisemitic? <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1597783530238451712">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RitchieTorres Some argue anti-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Zionism</span> is equivalent to anti-semitism. Others disagree. Debate on this topic has spanned decades/centuries, on right and left, and among Jews themselves. So no, your personal views are not "sufficiently generalizable" as a criterion for banning political speech</span></a> @mtracey Is there any debate about the Antisemitism of Kanye West and Nick Fuentes?  Is it merely my view that the two of them are Antisemites? <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1597787819338240000">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RitchieTorres "Kanye West and Nick Fuentes are anti-semites" is not a generalizable rule for determining the permissibility of political speech. It's just two people whose speech you recently found to be very bad. Then you make the leap from "this speech is bad" to "this speech must be banned"</span></a> @mtracey The generalizable rule is directed against Antisemitism.  There are gray areas that are open to debate but the cases of Kanye West and Nick Fuentes are not among them.  Their Antisemitism is pretty clear-cut. @mtracey When it comes to the gray areas, err on the side of free speech.  But when it comes to clear cut cases (and those cases do exist), content moderation becomes defensible (and I would argue) desirable. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1597796992893464576">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RitchieTorres If the generalizable rule simply prohibits anti-semitic speech, yet you "err on the side" of anti-semitic speech being allowed when it falls into a "gray area," maybe the rule itself is not workable -- seeing as it still requires making these subjective, debatable determinations</span></a> @mtracey Subjectivity is inevitable in human affairs.  I am part of Congress, which passes generally applicable rules (i.e. laws) whose enforcement and interpretation can be subjective and imperfect.  Does that mean we should abandon the enterprise of rulemaking? No. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1597802683066249216">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RitchieTorres Maybe what should be abandoned is this newfound assumption that the way to deal with political speech you find repugnant is to ban that speech from public forums. Because that's a fallacious assumption. Though I do agree Congress passes many "imperfect" laws, to put it politely</span></a> @mtracey Are you in favor of removing any content from social media platforms?  Child pornography?  Videos of animal cruelty?  The use of the n-word?   I get the impression that you object to any and all content moderation, not merely the scope and subjectivity of it. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1597806274447548418">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RitchieTorres Yes. There is certain content whose removal is easily justified on the basis of plainly worded, generalizable rules. Like direct, personal threats of physical violence. Or sexually graphic images of children. This requires no "gray area" parsing of impermissible political speech</span></a> @mtracey If Twitter were to ban a user for using the N-word—on the grounds that the N-word is offensive and racist—would you object? <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1597820909297229824">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RitchieTorres I wouldn't object to the rational enforcement of plainly worded, generalizable rules that don't require endowing tech bureaucrats with the power to unilaterally adjudicate what political speech is permissible -- often in reaction to external pressure from politicians and media</span></a> @mtracey You deflected my question.
