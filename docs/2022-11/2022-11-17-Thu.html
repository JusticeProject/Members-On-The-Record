"For over two decades, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, the U.S. has partnered with African nations to address key challenges. Next year, we will celebrate the 20th anniversary of President Bush's launch of PEPFAR. "And I look forward to ensuring that important work continues and is reauthorized. The U.S. has a legacy and a depth of investment of which to be proud. "In the last year, the U.S. has provided over a billion COVID-19 vaccines to African countries and nearly $2 billion to address unprecedented levels of food insecurity and famine in the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Horn of Africa</span>. We must also think long term about our investments in Africa. "While the U.S. offers partnership, the PRC &amp; Russia seek to leverage their offers of financing or security guarantees for their own political, economic, and security priorities. A perfect example of this is the CCP's debt trap diplomacy through their belt and road initiative. "When I meet with partners and allies around the world and ask why they are entering into dangerous agreements with the CCP, they tell me it is because we're not there. But we need to be. We cannot allow the CCP and Russia to exert their malign influence over this continent. "Promoting two-way trade and investment with African nations, and creating economic opportunity must be a top priority. That is why I am proud my bill, the Championing American Businesses through Diplomacy Act, was signed into law. "&amp; earlier this year, I introduced legislation to codify the Prosper Africa initiative – I want to thank CHM Meeks for his co-sponsorship. This effort coordinates the various tools of the U.S. government to speak w/ one voice &amp; support U.S. companies looking to invest in Africa. "I am, however, concerned by the administration's prioritization of climate goals over efforts to support Africans working to increase investment in energy and power generation...African leaders have made this concern clear. "We also cannot take the eye of the ball in the fight against ISIS and Al Qaeda networks that are growing across Africa. Al Shabab is the most well-financed terrorist network in the world. ISIS affiliates are active in over 20 African countries and attacks are increasing. "We need to get in front of these threats and address the underlying causes of fragility and extremism. That is why I am glad to have worked with former Chairman Engel, Senator Graham, and Senator Coons to enact the Global Fragility Act. "I look forward to hearing about the progress made towards implementation in coastal West Africa and Mozambique. I am proud that my bill, the Trans Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership Act, was enacted earlier this year to improve the response to terrorist threats in the Sahel. "We have many challenges and a lot of work to do. It's time to roll up our sleeves and get things done."</em>”</p>
