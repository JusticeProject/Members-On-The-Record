Their charge? Not wearing her hijab ‘properly.'  They stopped her. They forced her into a van. They beat this 22 year-old woman until she was brain dead. Since then, Iranians have stood up to the regime – protesting everywhere from the streets of Khuzestan to the pitch at the World Cup - risking everything to demand their rights &amp; to live free from fear. How has the Iranian regime responded to protests? With tear gas.  With torture. With live gunfire. &amp; now with executions &amp; no due process.  This shouldn't come as a surprise to any who have watched the regime's actions over the past 44 years. The United States &amp; the international community cannot be silent. We cannot look away.
