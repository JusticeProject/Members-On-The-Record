They formed one on <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Benghazi</span>, we formed one on the climate crisis, etc) @chambersfw1 But many are just about the ability of the house to govern itself and thr relative power of leadership vs rank and file members. How to ensure all voices are heard without tripping into anarchy.  How to decide which bills come to the floor, amendment protocols, etc. @chambersfw1 The concessions the wing nuts want, and McCarthy keeps granting are in the latter category and all skew towards anarchy.  They virtually guarantee a paralysis of the House by the extremists, government shutdown and debt default. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/twitter/status/1611385442347220995">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@SeanCasten Thanks.
