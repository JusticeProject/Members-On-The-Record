Ron DeSantis and the State of Florida for blocking the AP African American Studies course from being taught in Florida high schools. Students must be allowed to learn!</span></a> How dare does the Governor of Florida have the audacity to deny the study of the history of African Americans who helped build this country. African Americans, whose history includes slavery in this nation, are having their history denied and removed by a tyrannical Governor. Stand with all your strength, this is a Democracy and everyone's history deserves to be told. This is an issue of the denial of a fair and inclusive education. It's a denial of equal protection under the law under the 14th amendment. It's the denial of our birth right. The Governor of a single state? You have some nerve. March on, students and elected officials. See you in court, Governor! The Victory will be ours. @TheBlackCaucus</em>”</p>
