Let's explain why.  Thread: 1/ First, let's give them the benefit of the doubt.  They frame this as a bill to block sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China.  Here is how it is characterized in a right wing outlet.  <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/patriotism-unity/house-gop-moves-to-pass-ban-on-oil-reserve-sales-to-china-in-first-slate-of-bills">House GOP moves to pass ban on oil reserve sales to China in first slate of bills... | washingtonexaminer.com</a> 2/ They frame this as strategic (don't sell US oil to China) but also criticize the Biden administration for "politicizing" the SPR, releasing oil from the SPR just to lower prices before an election.  Let's parse that. 3/ At the end of 2022, SPR volumes were about 210 million barrels lower.  So that volume was indeed released.  Most of it of course was consumed domestically but - as a globally fungible commodity, some portion was no doubt exported.  HOWEVER... <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1612889594776719360/photo/1">Link to image</a> 4/ Domestic oil producers exported 6 million barrels per day EVERY DAY of 2022.  That's 6 x 365 = 2,190 million barrels per year, or 10X the volume released from the SPR (most of which, recall, was not exported). <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1612890118980833305/photo/1">Link to image</a> 5/ So IF the argument is that we shouldn't sell US oil to China, you should be clamping down not on those who operate the SPR, but rather on US producers.  They're the ones who are exporting the oil. 6/ The fact that the @HouseGOP is not trying to block the export of US oil to China makes it clear that this isn't about China.  It's about their second concern: namely, that SPR releases lowered the price of oil before an election. 7/ The price of gasoline did fall at the end of the year (supply demand balance do affect price) but they've stayed low. So it's not just about SPR. <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1612891298540752914/photo/1">Link to image</a> 8/ But @HouseGOP leadership wants high oil prices.  Mr. McCarthy is from Bakersfield, CA's oil producing center. Mr. Scalise represents all those gulf coast producers.  Their district's economies go up with the price of oil. 9/ If they framed this as wanting to bring money home to their district, we could respect them.  The Detroit delegation wants to sell cars.  The NYC delegation wants strong banks.  One shouldn't be surprised that the representatives from the oil patch want expensive oil. 10/ But instead, they are framing this as a national security issue or as a political stunt.  Both are provable nonsense, per above. But they know it's bad politics to say they want expensive oil, so they're hoping no one checks their math. Consider this thread a public service. 11/ A final note: a little over 2 years ago, the @GOP successfully conspired with the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> government to raise oil prices, so as to bring more money to US oil producers/refiners. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1578005749871026177?s=20&t=AplVGPMISwx5AElY8Hd_hQ">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">OPEC's slash in oil production this week should be called out for what it is: an attempt to enhance Russia's ability to wage an illegal war against Ukraine, and an attempt to meddle in US politics.  It is time for us to reconsider our military support for the region.  Thread:</span></a> 12/ It was notable that we could not get any Rs to sign on our bill last year to use those exact same tools to pressure the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span>s to raise production and bring prices down.  It's always been about sending money to the oil patch for them.  /fin</em>‚Äù</p>
