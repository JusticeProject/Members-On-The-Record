Today, under those in power, we are now on the verge of world war.  And the innocent victims are each nation's people paying taxes to those in power.  1/12 The US proxy war with Russia, in Ukraine (a non-NATO nation), benefits China the most.  It will only continue to hurt the US and many innocent people all over the world.  It's draining our military resources, driving inflation, hurting world trade, &amp; Americans don't support it. It could also result in the dollar no longer being the world's currency.  Because of our own arrogance and ‚Äúfight to save democracy‚Äù in non-NATO Ukraine, heavily sanctioned Russia is proving to the world that they don't need the US dollar or friendship to trade and thrive. Alliances are being forged between Russia, China, Iran, and many others including OPEC.  China wants to be the ultimate super power, militarily &amp; economically, and the trajectory may be too late to stop.  The war in Ukraine is forming a new modern day axis &amp; China is advancing. The rise of China is our own fault.  We enriched them decades ago by sending them our jobs.  That was really how we strengthened them.  Through unintended consequences, we opened the door to our enemy for our own selfish corporate profits &amp; gains. And like thieves they have stolen everything.  What started with jobs led to technology, patents, and processes.  Then we gave them the unthinkable.  We gave them our emergency independence.  Almost all of our critical supplies are made in China.  We are fools. Now China has the fastest growing military in world history while we are beating our chest on the verge of WW3 with Russia.  America, Russia, &amp; Ukraine are ALL doomed unless we all take a hard turn inward and correct ourselves.  If not, we all lose, and China will be the Victor. As the Biden Administration has failed in negotiations to stop Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> is taking action.  It must always be remembered what Iran says it will do to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> &amp; America when it becomes capable of doing so.  <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/wsj/status/1619715753531285506?s=46&t=nPCCY3Y1hEss0LI3uHEfFQ">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext"><span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> carried out a clandestine drone strike targeting a defense compound in Iran, according to U.S. officials and people familiar with the operation (WSJ News Exclusive | <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> Strikes Iran Amid New International Push to Contain Tehran)</span></a> &nbsp; <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/wsj/status/1619715753531285506">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext"><span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> carried out a clandestine drone strike targeting a defense compound in Iran, according to U.S. officials and people familiar with the operation (WSJ News Exclusive | <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> Strikes Iran Amid New International Push to Contain Tehran)</span></a> Wisely, Netanyahu intends to keep <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> out of the war in Ukraine.  And hopefully, yesterday's bombings don't get perceived as involvement.  Because involvement could lead to biblical outcomes and unsurprisingly our leaders seem blinded to understanding &amp; knowledge of this. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1619754208865193984/photo/1">Link to image</a> America needs to end the war in Ukraine immediately.  I voted NO to every penny &amp; repeatedly called for public audits bc the corruption of our $113 BILLION DOLLARS is known to our people.  The outcome will be wasting our military supplies &amp; killing more people, while China rises. Yet Warmongers in DC continue hell bent on defeating Russia with any means &amp; as much money possible, sending tanks, pledging fighter jets, and promising they will stop at nothing.  They've forgotten that our duty and pledge is to our own people, border, &amp; country. With our national debt over $31 TRILLION and a looming default on our debts once again pending yet another debt ceiling rise, a daily invasion at our border w/ approx 2,500 daily unknown Got-Aways &amp; fentanyl deaths at horrific record levels, I demand we put America First!  12/12</em>‚Äù</p>
