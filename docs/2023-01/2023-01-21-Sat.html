They are about to tee up another one this week, again designed to transfer $ from US consumers to US oil drillers.  Thread below from the last one.  Let's talk about the next one: <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1612888229933420568">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">The @HouseGOP this week is going to release a bill this week that is designed to raise the price of oil.  Let's explain why.  Thread:</span></a> 1/ Here's a summary of the mischief they are up to this week.  Their bill would say that if we release any oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, we also have to increase oil &amp; gas exploration on federal lands.  <a href="https://www.kunc.org/2023-01-18/house-gops-new-rules-make-it-easier-to-sell-off-public-lands-encourage-drilling">House GOP's new rules make it easier to sell off public lands, encourage drilling... | kunc.org</a> 2/ First, and least significantly... oil and gas are two different things.  Releasing oil from reserves and drilling for more gas to make up the shortfall is like adding turkey to your shopping list because you ran out of milk.  But the point isn't logic.  It's just extractive 3/ Second, thanks to @SecGranholm for making the point that these bills only raise the price of gasoline at the pump.  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-energy-chief-warns-republicans-that-oil-bill-would-raise-pump-prices-2023-01-18/">Exclusive: U.S. energy chief warns Republicans that oil bill would raise pump prices... | reuters.com</a> 4/ But it's important to also raise a larger point about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve ("SPR").  It was created in 1975 in response to the 1st OPEC price shocks to provide a domestic buffer against future global market volatility / supply constraints. 5/ But the conditions for which it was created changed in October 2019.  That's when the US - for the first time - became a net oil exporter.  We've remained one since. <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1616834029109628931/photo/1">Link to image</a> 6/ That means that for the last 4 years, we have not one but TWO tools we could use to protect us from global volatility.  We could release oil from the SPR OR we could reduce exports and prioritize US oil for US use. 7/ As an economic matter, both are equivalent.  A barrel added to domestic supplies is a barrel we don't have to import and an additional barrel of supply, easing domestic prices.  Moreover, the volume we export today is WAY bigger than the amount we can release from the SPR. 8/ However, the politics changed in 2019.  Prior to that point, releases from the SPR were seen primarily as a benefit from US consumers.  Since then it has ALSO been seen as a reduction in revenue available to US oil exporters. 9/ To state the obvious: every American is an energy consumer while a tiny minority are oil exporters.  The greater good is always to lower US energy prices.  But - as I noted before - @HouseGOP leadership is beholden to the exporters. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1612891702984904723?s=20&t=01ARmKIdu4i6b78lWXxBYw">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">8/ But @HouseGOP leadership wants high oil prices.  Mr. McCarthy is from Bakersfield, CA's oil producing center. Mr. Scalise represents all those gulf coast producers.  Their district's economies go up with the price of oil.</span></a> 10/ The energy policy of the @HouseGOP isn't that complicated.  They want to raise oil &amp; gas company revenue by raising the price of oil. 11/ And they aren't particularly subtle about it.  In April 2020, they threatened to pull US troops out of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> unless they curtailed production to raise oil prices. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1578008937562939392?s=20&t=01ARmKIdu4i6b78lWXxBYw">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">4/ In response, a group of  @GOP Senators introduced a bill to pull US troops out of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia unless they slashed oil production. On the logic that this would raise oil prices and provide welfare to the neediest amongst us - the US oil sector. (Bill would remove U.S. troops from <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia in 30 days... | reuters.com)</span></a> 12/ Trump carried out the threat, the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span>s delivered and the @GOP celebrated. <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trump-saudi-arabia-russia-opec-oil-deal-role">Trump plays key role in brokering historic oil deal... | foxbusiness.com</a> 13/ And now they are cranky.  Because Biden used the SPR to lower oil prices.  They are CLAIMING this is about our precious, domestic, apple-pie-smelling crude and our need to keep it local.  But that's all BS, since they aren't doing anything to curtail exports. 14/ And the bill they are dropping this week would not only raise prices (by limiting the ability to make draws from the SPR) but would  also increase exportable oil (by increasing drilling on public lands). 15/ The math is straightforward.  The policy goals are as obvious as the policy implications.  But rest assured that the @GOP spin this week won't be honest about either.  Call 'em on it.  /fin <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/twitter/status/1616836469489897475">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@SeanCasten @HouseGOP A simple policy of releasing oil when prices are above $100 a barrel and replace if prices fall to 50 a barrel. It could fund expansion of the reserve and reduce risk for the industry and consumers. Oil $ is  likely to be more volatile as we switch to EVs and investment declines.</span></a> @mdad8200 @HouseGOP Indeed, and my friend @FrankPallone has a bill that does that.
