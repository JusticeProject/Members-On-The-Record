In the decades since its founding, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>'s rich culture &amp; thriving economy have flourished amid existential challenges. The United States takes great pride in our ironclad bond with <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>, cemented minutes after its founding and rooted in both mutual security and shared values. In February, I had the privilege of leading a Congressional Delegation to Jerusalem, where we met with <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>i leaders and made clear our commitment to the U.S.-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> relationship. Unwavering and bipartisan in our support, the House has proudly renewed funding for <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>'s self-defense.  And by securing an additional $1 billion for the Iron Dome system, the House strengthened <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>'s ability to protect civilians from missile attacks. As the world celebrates all that <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> has achieved, we must also continue paving the path to justice, peace and stability in the region.  This year's historic Negev Summit marked a promising step toward building on the Abraham Accords. As the House restated in our 2019 resolution, we remain committed to a just and lasting two-state solution to ‘both ensure the state of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>'s survival as a Jewish and democratic state and fulfill the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a state of their own.' House Democrats will continue working alongside the Biden Administration to preserve an enduring U.S.-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> partnership that advances democratic values for generations to come. <a href="https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/5422-0">Pelosi Statement Celebrating <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>i Independence Day... | speaker.gov</a></em>”</p>
