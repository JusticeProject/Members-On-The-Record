Instead of potentially killing the enemy it take 3 off the battlefield. The 1 wounded and 2 to carry him/her off.</span></a> @PKnoepfle Yes that is what I was taught in the Marines. Everything about this weapon is designed to kill as many people as fast as possible. Even the forward hand grip and the “gun grip” is designed for you to keep your weapon on target as you fire. It literally has cooling fins so the gun doesn't warp as you fire bullets.  You don't need that hunting game. It is actually important if you are moving and shooting at your enemy if they are moving. I don't know if he used that weapon but I saw that he had an EOTECH site on one of his weapons. That would let him site on target faster probably making him very lethal against law enforcement. Probably making them engage from further distances.  @AlpineUnendlich I actually think we shouldn't take weapons from people. I think 18 years olds should have a uniform restriction on weapons. It is federal law that 18 years can't buy hand guns, same should be for weapons that are designed to have such a rapid rate of fire. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1529569936133300231">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RubenGallego Here we go blaming inanimate objects again, you would think to be in your position you should have an IQ higher than a squirrels but guess not.

I did a couple of drills and was able to get on quickly.  I used an ACOG in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span>, for CQB would have preferred an EOTECH. @LMR_Sahara He was probably engaging at less than 50, the police would have been outmatched. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1529574749491593216">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RubenGallego Yeah in a close environment a EOtech would be preferable to a 4x ACOG.

It's in the picture.  Also there is nothing emotional about the gun grip. I used to keep my stock weld. you can't keep a good stock weld with out a gun grip especially if you are engaging multiple targets.  @AlpineUnendlich I was pointing out how dangerous this weapon is. Also I sent weapons to Ukraine because I think they should should have the ability to kill as many Russians as they can to defend themselves. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1529582746313445376">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RubenGallego @AlpineUnendlich 18 year olds CAN join the military, correct?

Welcome to my Tedtalk.  @AlpineUnendlich @GreenleeGazette That sounds like you have data.  Show us where you found that?  @AlpineUnendlich I don't think you know what you are taking about. We should make it illegal to sell weapons of this type to kids under 21.  @AlpineUnendlich No I don't think you have a coherent argument so you are just using straw man arguments. Did you object to the hand gun restriction for people under the age of 21? Probably not.  I actually think you know very little about weapons.
