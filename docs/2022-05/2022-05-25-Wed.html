The funding will enable the clinic to provide needed community and culturally informed health care services and programming to more members of the LGBTQI community, immigrants, and communities of color. $1.5 million for @DefenderOrg to intensify LEAD - a community-based diversion program for low-level crime related to substance use disorder - in the Chinatown-International District and expand services to Southeast Seattle, including Rainier Beach, Columbia City and Mount Baker. $1.5 million for the @CityofRenton to develop Logan Place Market, which will be a vibrant marketplace for residents and an incubator space for small businesses with a particular focus on minority-owned, women-owned, and historically disadvantaged businesses in downtown Renton. $2,601,858 for the Cowlitz Indian Tribe to support the Cowlitz Tribal Health Seattle Clinic's interdependent programming, expand its services, and create an integrated health care campus to serve American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) living in the King County area.
