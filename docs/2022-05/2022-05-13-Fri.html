He died in 2005 here in Florida. As we celebrate #JewishAmericanHeritageMonth, here's his story. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepValDemings/status/1524819108902100997/photo/1">Link to image</a> Will was born in New York and frequently got into fights as a child when harassed for his Jewish heritage. His family was poor, but his father encouraged his interest in art. As a child during the Great Depression he worked drawing for pulp magazines to bring in family income. Soon, he started drawing his own, and began to revolutionize comics, establishing the ‚Äúgraphic novel‚Äù as a serious art form. During World War II and after, he drew cartoons for the U.S. Army, teaching soldiers how to maintain their equipment. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepValDemings/status/1524819113457090563/photo/1">Link to image</a> In his art, he addressed serious topics, focusing particularly on the Jewish-American experience. Author Michael Chabon said, ‚ÄúHe was unquestionably the first person who ever took comic books seriously as an art form.‚Äù Today, the ‚ÄúEisner Awards‚Äù are the highest honor in the comics industry. His work helped to inspire later graphic novels, including others focused on the Jewish experience like the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Holocaust</span> story Maus, which won the Eisner Award in 1992. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepValDemings/status/1524819118658138112/photo/1">Link to image</a> Eisner's embrace of his Jewish-American heritage and of an often-discounted art form helped change how stories are told in America and around the world. #MediaDiversity #JewishAmericanHeritageMonth <a href="https://twitter.com/RepValDemings/status/1524819122818891776/photo/1">Link to image</a></em>‚Äù</p>
