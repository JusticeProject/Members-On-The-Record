It is a solemn and sacred day that we remember and pay homage to the military members who have made the ultimate sacrifice. America remains a very divided nation.  However, if you are looking for something to bring us together, you need to look no further than Memorial Day itself. Unlike Veterans Day, which is a celebration of those who have served our nation in uniform, Memorial Day is a somber occasion to remember the sacrifice made by those who never made it home. Throughout American history, young men and women have gone to faraway places to fight for freedom and to protect American interests.  Over the course of our nation's history hundreds of thousands of Americans have died in these conflicts, most of them in the prime of their lives. They never fully enjoyed the experiences that come with a long life ‚Äì celebrating children, grandchildren, and life experiences with family and friends.  For them, all was lost. No matter if you are a conservative, liberal, moderate or politically agnostic, it is important for all of us to remember our differences are made possible by being a free people with independent thoughts and actions. While we should all cherish our ability to be our own captain in charting our destiny, we should also recognize we are all in this together. The best thing we can do to honor the sacrifice of those lost in the service to our country is to ensure America remains a very special place worth dying for. If we want to maintain our freedoms and our way of life, we should recommit ourselves to the American experience, which is the most unique on the planet. We must also realize that freedom is not guaranteed and is always just one generation away from being lost. America is the place where people from all over the world ‚Äì different backgrounds, languages, and cultures ‚Äì come together to form a strong nation based on enduring values: the right to pick one's leaders, right to speak one's mind, right to fail, get up and start all over again. I am reminded from my travels around the world where groups like <span class="MOTR_Keyword">al-Qaeda</span>, ISIS, and other terrorist organizations operate.   They hate our way of life because we can choose how to worship God, if we worship at all. We pick our leaders, not have them imposed on us. We choose our own destiny and enjoy virtually unlimited freedoms.  In the terrorists' world, these freedoms should not exist. Throughout America, in towns and cities large and small, monuments exist in honor of those who gave their lives in service of our nation. The hard truth is there will be future conflicts and Americans will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifice in order for America to maintain its freedom. As for me, I will try to be a better American in honor of those who gave their lives to ensure I keep the rights I possess today.    We all owe that to those brave Americans we remember this #MemorialDay.</em>‚Äù</p>
