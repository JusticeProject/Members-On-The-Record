As the grandson of a World War II veteran, I am deeply grateful for American service members around the world who have dedicated their lives to keeping our country safe and free. 2/7 More than one million Americans have given their lives on battlefields seared into our history. Before they went to war, these American heroes were first a son, or daughter, a spouse, a parent, a brother or sister, a neighbor, or a friend. 3/7 Nothing replaces the anguish of losing someone so special — but our Fallen and our Missing in Action will never be forgotten by a profoundly grateful nation. 4/7 The need to continue to care for our veterans and their families will remain a top priority of mine for as long as I have the honor to serve in Congress. My staff and I will continue to work in a bipartisan way to assist and deliver. No veteran should go hungry or homeless. 5/7 Our next major effort is to make sure that we are truly taking care of our <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> and Afghanistan veterans who were exposed to burn pits and have had health issues as a result. 6/7 Thank you again to all the military families and those who greatly support them in our district and around the country.
