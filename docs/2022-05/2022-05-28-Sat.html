As Albert's daughter explains, “a common practice for <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Jewish</span> soldiers during World War II was to hide their religious identities for fear of retribution.” Because of that, he was buried in France with a grave marker bearing the Christian cross. @OperBenjamin is a nonprofit that works with the @usabmc to replace grave markers of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Jewish</span> service members, like Albert, with the Star of David. As we honor our fallen and reflect on their courage and sacrifice on Memorial Day, please take a moment to read this piece on what @OperBenjamin's mission means to the families of these heroes. <a href="https://www.kansascity.com/opinion/readers-opinion/guest-commentary/article261745367.html">My dad never came back to Kansas City from war.
