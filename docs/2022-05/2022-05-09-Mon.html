That advice has carried me through my career, my personal life, and everything in between. <a href="https://twitter.com/ElissaSlotkin/status/1523354236724998144/photo/1">Link to image</a> I've been thinking about my mom a lot lately as we process the news of a draft Supreme Court opinion that would overturn Roe v. Wade. It's hard to imagine how upset she'd be — I know she is rolling in her grave thinking about the ways that we're turning back the clock on women's freedom to make choices about their lives. My mom was lively, spirited, and ahead of her time in so many ways. She taught me to be independent, assertive, and to seek out opportunities to challenge myself, to push myself, and to grow. I can remember very specific instances when this mattered: In 2005, I was working as the intelligence briefer to the ambassador in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span>. I remember the day he told me he would soon be nominated to be the first Director of National Intelligence. I asked if I could work for him. His response? “We leave for DC on Monday.” It was a tough thing to ask – my heart was racing the entire time – but I couldn't ignore my mom's voice in my head. It's what she would have wanted me to do. That opportunity led to many others. So that one question, and a lot of hard work, led me to where I am today.</em>”</p>
