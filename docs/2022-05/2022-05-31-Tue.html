First, because my husband is an Army veteran who served as an Apache helicopter pilot. We met in Baghdad ‚Äî I was a CIA officer who served alongside our military on three tours in Iraq. But mostly today, I remember a close friend of mine, Major Stuart Wolfer. It was a Friday night on my third tour in Baghdad in 2008 when we had a religious service and went to the chow hall together. On Sunday of that weekend, he was killed by an <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>ian rocket in the Green Zone. Every year we recognize him. He had two little kids at home, and now his children are grown. I got to meet with his sister about a month ago, just off the floor of the House, as she lobbied for issues important to Gold Star families. All of the things that we got to do this weekend ‚Äî enjoy our families, go out for lunch, all of our favorite activities ‚Äî are because someone preserved our ability to be free and live the life we want to live. I honor Stu today, along with all the others who have lost their lives in defense of our way of life.</em>‚Äù</p>
