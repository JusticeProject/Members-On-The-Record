(2/6) They simply say that if you're a gun owner, you have a responsibility to reasonably secure your weapon out of reach of children. And if a child does access and use your weapon in a crime, such as they did in Oxford, you can be held accountable. (3/6) Senator Rosemary Bayer introduced the state legislation, and I introduced the companion legislation at the federal level. We're now in discussions about moving it to a vote in the House. (4/6) This shouldn't be a political issue: kids deserve to be safe in their schools and in their homes.
