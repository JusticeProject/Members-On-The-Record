This tragedy hit home for me. My daughter was named at this synagogue and I knew families there. Our nation can and must do more to combat anti<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span>. Anti<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span> is on the rise in our country. Last year, the @ADL found that antisemitic incidents reached an all-time high in the United States since they started tracking 40 years ago. We can't sit idly by and watch the Jewish community fall victim to more hate. As the husband of a Jewish woman and the father of four Jewish children, this is personal. We need to call out anti<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span> when we see it, educate young folks, and take action to protect the Jewish community here at home and around the world. The memories of the 11 Jewish Americans killed four years ago will not be forgotten.
