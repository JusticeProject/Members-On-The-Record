It is time for us to reconsider our military support for the region.  Thread: 1/ @RepMalinowski, @RepSusanWild and I introduced legislation this morning to do exactly that. <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1578006101123104769/photo/1">Link to image</a> 2/ For context, it's worth understanding what our world was like just 2.5 years ago.  GDP was in free fall, unemployment was spiking, global travel was frozen and demand for oil was collapsing, taking oil prices along with it. <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1578007308763807745/photo/1">Link to image</a> 3/ This collapse in energy use led to a direct, measured reduction in annual CO2 emissions. <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1578008016045178885/photo/1">Link to image</a> 4/ In response, a group of  @GOP Senators introduced a bill to pull US troops out of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia unless they slashed oil production. On the logic that this would raise oil prices and provide welfare to the neediest amongst us - the US oil sector. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-usa-senate/bill-would-remove-u-s-troops-from-saudi-arabia-in-30-days-idUSKCN21R3HG">Bill would remove U.S. troops from <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia in 30 days... | reuters.com</a> 5/ Trump echoed that message directly from the White House.  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-trump-saudi-specialreport/special-report-trump-told-saudi-cut-oil-supply-or-lose-u-s-military-support-sources-idUSKBN22C1V4">Special Report: Trump told <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span>: Cut oil supply or lose U.S. military support - sources</a> 6/ And here's the deal: it "worked".  Oil production was slashed.  Crude prices spiked 24% the next day.  The @GOP got what they wanted.  Fox news praised them. Your cost of living went up.  Again: this was just 2.5 years ago.  <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/trump-saudi-arabia-russia-opec-oil-deal-role">Trump plays key role in brokering historic oil deal... | foxbusiness.com</a> 7/ Fast forward to today.  Oil prices are too high.  We passed the #InflationReductionActto to decouple from petro-state volatility &amp; grow our economy with cheaper energy.  We are on the cusp of the biggest wealth transfer in our history from energy producers to energy consumers. 8/ It will slash CO2 emissions by 40% relative to 2005 levels AND leave Americans richer.  That is a threat to OPEC.  It is also a threat to the @GOP.  Every one of them voted against cheaper energy, and they want to overturn it if they win the House.  <a href="https://www.americanprogressaction.org/article/what-house-minority-leader-kevin-mccarthys-commitment-to-maga-extremism-will-mean-for-americans/">What House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's Commitment to MAGA Extremism Will Mean for Americans... | americanprogressaction.org</a> 9/ Meanwhile, Russia has an economy that depends on oil revenue.  The higher the oil price, the more money they have to kill Ukrainians and risk European peace.  That's why the US and our allies are so focused not only on cutting off that cash flow.  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-treasury-seeks-three-phased-russian-fuel-price-cap-2022-10-04/">U.S. Treasury seeks three-phased Russian fuel price cap... | reuters.com</a> 10/ So what will OPEC's production cut do?  It will boost the oil price, bringing more revenue to Putin, MBS and @SenatorCassidy's oil-dependent regions.  It will also kill more Ukrainians, raise costs for US consumers and hurt POTUS electorally. 11/ That brings no benefit to the US collectively, democracy, human rights or the post-WWII order.  And so, @RepMalinowski, @RepSusanWild and I have introduced the exact same bill @SenatorCassidy led 2.5 years ago, but this time putting the interests of US consumers first. 12/ Here is the bill text.  And here is my challenge to our @GOP colleagues: if you care about US consumers, energy costs and democracy, this is your chance to prove it.  Sign on.  Join us.  Or else at least have the courage to acknowledge your hypocrisy.  /fin Postscript: link I forgot to post to bill text. <a href="https://malinowski.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/malinowski.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/MALINJ_133_xml_0.pdf">Link to PDF | malinowski.house.gov</a></em>”</p>

U.S. policy has swung like a pendulum between Trump &amp; Biden, but these countries have long-benefitted from our support for the last 60 years. 3/ At best, the cartel has rejected any idea of being a helpful actor &amp; chosen profit over aiding the world economy. At worst, they've made a conscious choice to align themselves with Putin over the U.S. 4/ Either way, as many of us have been saying for a year, it's time for some tougher diplomacy with real stakes. If the administration is reticent to threaten U.S. equipment, Congress should be ready to do so. 5/ In the meantime, we need to prioritize U.S. energy security. We need an all-of-the-above approach to energy resilience, from U.S. supplies, to alternative energy, including nuclear power &amp; everything in between. 6/ Redundancy is how we manage threats like the one now from OPEC. In the short-term, I'll repeat what we should do to impact gas prices: suspend the federal gas tax, tap into the SPR to raise supply &amp; take decisive diplomatic action against states that claim to be our partners.</em>”</p>
