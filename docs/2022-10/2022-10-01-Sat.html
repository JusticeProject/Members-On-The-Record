Humanitarian NGOs, especially Ukrainian ones, already struggle to navigate existing sanctions and this would create even more red tape and even pause operations as they comply with new restrictions. People thousands of miles from Ukraine will also suffer.   Anywhere there's a Russian presence in an active humanitarian operation ‚Äì like <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span>, Mali, and Sudan ‚Äì humanitarian organizations would need to pause and make sure they aren't violating new U.S. sanctions.
