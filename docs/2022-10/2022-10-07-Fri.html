Short thread: 1/ First, just look at what capital markets are doing.  Exxon, Chevron, Shell are all trading at price / earnings ratios of 7 - 10.  First Solar, Tesla, NextEra are trading at 30 - 100.  Investors are 5 - 10x more excited about the future prospects in cleantech. 2/ There is nothing surprising about that.  If company A produces widgets for $10 and company B makes them for $2, you'd view company B as a better long term investment in Big Widget.  And it's cheaper to warm your home, drive to work and power your factory with clean energy. 3/ The whole energy conversation is so politicized, but this isn't fundamentally different from any other tech revolution.  Innovators make cheaper, better tech, capital markets follow and old buggy whip manufacturers are left behind. 4/ That in turn is leading to unprecedented collapses in US fossil fuel demand.  That's good for the environment and for energy consumers. BUT... it also represents a massive wealth transfer from energy producers to consumers.  You have more money in your pocket.  Exxon has less. 5/ You may not shed a tear for Exxon in this tale.  But what about the folks on the Gulf Coast who's livelihood depends on oil &amp; gas extraction?  Or in Appalachia who depend on coal?  They are Americans.  They kept us warm and well lit for the last decade.  We owe them dignity. 6/ And yet, we have a lousy track-record of looking out for folks caught up in these transitions.  Mining automation made consumers wealthier but was terrible for John Henry.  Agricultural innovation kept food prices down but left the Joads behind. 7/ What we SHOULD do is ensure that as we "make the pie higher" everyone gets a slice.  Help folks get retrained if they want, move if they want or at least live with dignity where they are.  Significant portions of the #InflationReductionAct sought to do exactly that. 8/ And yet not a single Republican voted for that bill.  Who, coincidentally are vastly more likely to represent the energy-extractive parts of America who are already losing out in this transition.  Why not? 9/ In short, because of the tragedy.  Losers always cry in Washington louder than winners cheer.  Rather than embrace the transition, they are fighting to subsidize failing industries that can't compete.  They are trying to push back the tide. 10/ Here's just one recent example in Lousiana where they are trying to bully investors into keeping their investments in the least productive sectors.  <a href="https://www.nola.com/news/politics/article_8959f70c-4594-11ed-b11e-9bda6f31e511.html?utm_medium=email">State treasurer accuses giant investment firm of putting politics ahead of taxpayers... | nola.com</a> 11/ Investors choosing to put capital in companies that deliver 70x earnings instead of those that only deliver 7x earnings isn't "woke capitalism".  It's capitalism.  And capitalism is really scary when your community is tied to an industry that is struggling to compete. 12/ And thus the Greek tragedy.  Political leaders in the regions who most need help are doubling down on their foibles.  State pension funds are going to have less access to high-returns in those states where folks are going to become most dependent on a well-funded safety net. 13/ They are also directly funding groups like the State Financial Officers Foundation who are anti-market, anti-environment and are preparing draft legislation that will protect energy producers, but at the expense of all the people who most need help. 14/ I talked about this with Jamie Dimon and other bank CEOs a few weeks ago.  <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/RepCasten/status/1573667316687990784?s=20&t=fJDmcmozEFWU2z6h9eNxhg">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">During this week's @FSCDems hearing, I asked @JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon to commit to stop funding a group that spreads climate financial disinformation.  We cannot continue to ignore the financial risk of the climate crisis. (Link to twitter.com)</span></a> 15/ It's also why I've been so focused on making sure  our financial regulators are monitoring the flows of capital that result from climate change.  Not just the losses from fires and floods, but also the flight to quality, away from extractive America. <a href="https://casten.house.gov/media/press-releases/casten-feinstein-introduce-bill-reduce-climate-change-risk-financial-system">Casten, Feinstein Introduce Bill to Reduce Climate Change Risk in Financial System | Representative Sean Casten</a> 16/ In the meantime though we are still left with this tragedy.  The politicians who are politicizing the problem are making life worse for their constituents... while making those same folks ever more receptive to scapegoating arguments.  It's a vicious cycle. 17/ We break the cycle with facts.  With truth.  And with empathy for our fellow Americans who are at risk.  Their local leaders may not be standing up for them.  It's on the rest of us to step up and lead with love. /fin A brief postscript.
