Feeding war doesn't help people.  Peace helps people.  We are ensuring destruction, and deep down you must know this.  Another trillion on wars on the other hemisphere does not make peace.</span></a> @AttilaTheLund If we are speaking from a financial perspective, there has been far more public debate on Ukraine assistance than on 70%+ of our public outlays. I agree that peace helps- Russia troops leave Ukraine and war ends. Standing by while Ukraine falls will cost US far more in long-term. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1582276538418233345">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RepMeijer This is true, but the public has an appetite for war. We crave freedom fries. We crave the Holy War. Miniver Cheevy are we all.  You may be right on the overall benefit to the US of warfare.  War pays dividends (and can be a bargain). But my daughters will not collect the spoils.</span></a> @AttilaTheLund 💯 on public appetite.

That's why I've been the leading GOP in 117th Congress to return war powers to congress. But IRQ/AFG ≠ UKR</em>”</p>
