Getting to the negotiating table is wise with a position of strength.  The U.S. must rapidly increase drilling to a maximum level and drive the cost of oil as low as possible.  When oil is not as valuable/needed, the balance of power will shift, affecting more than Russia. 2. The Biden Admins current trajectory, driving American energy to the Green New Deal and chosen dependency on foreign oil &amp; batteries, is foolish and irresponsible.  Our government has made us dependent on China, and China has opened their arms to Russia, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>, &amp; Venezuela. 3. While innocent people are being murdered in Putin's war on Ukraine, the U.S. response is critical.  The world is on the brink of two competing global currency systems, the Dollar and the Yuen.  Once the switch is made, things are not easily undone &amp; it could make things worse. 4. As China has been increasingly buying <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>ian and Venezuelan oil without care of sanctions, it's obvious they will continue to partner with sanctioned countries and grow their economic power.  Xi has already made a big oil and gas deal with Putin.  Why stop now? 5. Foolish America Last and China First policies relying on China for our manufacturing and supplies has led us to this weakened position.  It's hard to beat the bully on the playground when you have to turn around and buy lunch from them.  Winning starts by making our own lunch. 6.
