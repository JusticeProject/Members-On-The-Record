It's time for @StateDept to do the same.   This bill includes $8 million I led the charge for to fund paid @StateDept internships &amp; ensure that public service is open to all.   I thank @RepBarbaraLee for working with me to make it happen. <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/12/16/unpaid-internships-foreign-policy-government/#">Washington's Foreign-Policy Machine Runs on Unpaid Interns | foreignpolicy.com</a> Our security — and the security of our allies — depend on the integrity of our intelligence community.   I authored language in this bill that prohibits employees of @CIA &amp; @NSAGov from working for foreign governments after they leave government service.   <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spying-raven/">Exclusive: Ex-NSA cyberspies reveal how they helped hack foes of UAE | reuters.com</a> Every child deserves to grow up safe and healthy.   This bill includes $27 million that @RepBrianFitz and I fought for @USAID to help vulnerable children around the world.   This money builds on the passage of our Global Child Thrive Act, which was enacted into law last year. The United States' engagement with the Indo-Pacific is critical to our security and prosperity   I'm excited that this bill includes $21.5 million I pushed for to help the @Asia_Foundation expand their international development work and promote good governance, and equality. Supporting young leaders is how we build resilient democracies. The @StateDept's @YSEALI program does just that.   This 2022 appropriations bill includes $7.8M for this important program, which supports people-to-people exchanges between the US &amp; ASEAN to develop young leaders. We know that foreign assistance is most effective and sustainable when we work directly with local organizations.   This bill includes necessary language that the @HispanicCaucus and I pushed for to enable @USAID to support locally-led development in the Northern Triangle. We say that <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia is an ally but their government has consistently failed to control extremist ideologies.   This bill requires the Director of National Intelligence to shine a light on <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia's role in spreading extremism by reporting to Congress. When the United States provides security assistance to another country, we have a responsibility to ensure that it is not being used to violate human rights.   I'm glad to see that this bill requires a report I called for to document human rights violations by these nations.</em>”</p>
