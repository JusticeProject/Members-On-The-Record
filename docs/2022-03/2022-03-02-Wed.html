𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Increase domestic energy production by ending the ban on federal energy leases (that the Biden administration implemented just last week!) so we can lessen our reliance on foreign oil. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺: Rampant inflation hurting the most vulnerable Americans who are now paying more for housing, groceries, and everything else. 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: End the runaway government spending that grows government instead of the economy. 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗯𝗹𝗲𝗺: Record-breaking illegal border crossings. 𝗦𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Stop demonizing border patrol agents, prosecute those caught crossing illegally, and finish he border wall (They put up walls to protect politicians, we should do the same for the rest of the country).

"In addition, @POTUS must comply with the law requiring that he report twice a year on how we are using the 2001 AUMF...DOD submitted some of the delinquent reports. But they have still not submitted the report due last Dec. that would cover the disastrous Afghanistan w/drawal. "For months, I implored the Biden administration – repeatedly – to take #Russia's renewed aggression against #Ukraine seriously.   "And for months, very few substantive actions were taken. "In a decision that still baffles me, @POTUS waived congressionally mandated sanctions on the Russian malign influence project #NordStream2...Let me be clear: enriching Putin &amp; making Europe more dependent on Russian natural gas is absolutely not in America's 'national interest.' "Putin was allowed to build up nearly 200,000 Russian troops near #Ukraine's border with no consequences.  We were told by President Biden that sanctions at that time were not needed. That the 'threat' of sanctions would deter #Russia.   "But, clearly, the president was wrong. "@ZelenskyyUa &amp; the Ukrainian people are inspiring the world as they risk their lives by standing in front of tanks...Putin has underestimated the strength &amp; the bravery &amp; the resiliency of the Ukrainian people to his own peril. But the courageous Ukrainian people need our help. "As President Zelensky reminded us over the weekend – he doesn't need a ride out of his country. He needs lethal weapons to fight for his country. To fight for his people. "I'm pleased the administration has finally begun to enact significant sanctions on Russia. But more is still needed – most importantly, secondary sanctions on designated Russian banks. "Furthermore, President Biden must stop American dollars from funding Putin's war machine by cutting off US imports of #Russian oil. Energy exports are the lifeblood of the Russian economy. And we should not be allowing #Putin to use that lifeblood to spill blood in Ukraine. "We also need to isolate #Russia diplomatically as well as economically. It should be obvious that Russia should not be serving as one of the key brokers of an #<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span> nuclear deal while they are waging a war against Ukraine. "It is also gravely concerning the administration apparently doesn't want Congress to review their new deal.

It has nothing to do with short-term energy demand from Russia.  Put the dog-whistle away children; the adults have work to do. 11/ So what should we do?  First, it is great to see Germany revisiting their decisions to phase out nuclear power.  Keeping those generators on line eases demand for natural gas (Nordstream or otherwise) in Western Europe.  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/germany-step-up-plans-cut-dependence-russia-gas-2022-02-27/">Germany to step up plans to cut dependence on Russia gas... | reuters.com</a> 12/ Second, let's be clear-eyed about global oil production capacity.  There is a country with the underground resources AND above ground production capacity to quickly ramp up production and shut down Russian demand: <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia. 13/ Any rapid ramp down in Russian demand that is stapled to maintaining consistent oil supply is therefore predicated on ramping <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> production.  The US simply doesn't have the short-term swing capacity. 14/ It's not about what we want to happen.  This is what WILL happen in a world that stops demanding Russian gas given dynamics of the market and existing capacity. 15/ But that's only in the short-term.  In the medium/long term we'd all like to live in a world where our quality of life and energy bills do not depend on the vagaries of politics in Russia or <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia nor put the survival our species at risk. <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/">Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability - IPCC Working Group II contribution to the Sixth Assessment Report</a> 16/ Getting to that point requires investment.  In efficiency. In renewables.  In EVs.  In electrification.  In the biggest wealth transfer in the history of our species from energy producers - with all their attendant risks - to energy consumers (e.g., everyone) 17/ Those who are arguing that we should instead invest in more fossil infrastructure are either evil or stupid.  Neither is a basis for policy making, notwithstanding how persuasive their arguments have historically been.  /fin Post-script: we are all in this together and should be prepared to economically sacrifice.  Oil and gas markets are BRUTALLY efficient in the sense that they they will swap suppliers on a moments notice to save a few pennies per MMBtu.... ...so shutting off Russian supply implicitly means shifting some part of our market to slightly higher priced supplies.  Your gasoline will get more expensive in the short-term.  That will be painful.  But it is a small sacrifice compared to that being borne by the Ukrainians. I suspect some of my colleagues will try to score political points from that price increase.  Don't let them. /fin (and this time, I really mean it!)</em>”</p>

(2/6) It was tremendously upsetting that the President didn't recognize the American service members who died under his watch because of his mishandled <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> withdrawal, including one of Nebraska's own, Corporal Daegan Page. (3/6) With respect to domestic issues – President Biden did not propose solutions to assuage the economic pressure and frustration the American people are feeling. Nebraskans know the very real pain caused by inflation with rising gas, energy, and food costs. (4/6) In many cases, he doubled down on his support for the same reckless, far-left policies that will raise taxes and increase the national debt. (5/6) Under his agenda, the American people will continue to face rising daily costs, limited energy independence and Western reliance on Russian oil, an open border and drug crisis, and one-size-fits-all government mandates.

Virtually every major crisis our nation faces today has been caused or exacerbated by President Biden. Tonight Americans deserved to hear real solutions. It was an opportunity for President Biden to acknowledge the challenges we face and deliver a call to action that was unifying, bipartisan, &amp; results oriented. It was a chance for Joe Biden to stop talking about how he's the “unity” president and to finally start acting like it. Unfortunately for our nation, President Biden failed to deliver. I deeply appreciated the bipartisan solidarity shown tonight for the brave Ukrainian people as well as the strong condemnation of Vladimir Putin's premeditated and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. But beyond that this speech was a return to Joe Biden's same partisan rhetoric. It was a divisive attempt to shift blame and salvage a failing presidency, all while ignoring our country's most pressing issues. The list of challenges is long and growing: 40-year high inflation, an open border, a deadly fentanyl epidemic, a hollowed out domestic energy industry, war in Europe, a failed withdrawal from <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>, unprecedented government spending, and massive supply chain disruptions. President Biden once again failed to acknowledge these challenges let alone present a unifying, commonsense vision for how he plans to address them.</em>”</p>

He's going to tell you how much better his administration has made everything…and how much better you'd have it if Republicans would just go along. But, here's the real #SOTU &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; On Day 1, Biden stopped construction of the wall along the southwest border and signaled to immigrants that the border was open.   Our Border Patrol agents have been turned into a search and rescue team, spending their time and resources helping illegals safely across the border. Seizure of fentanyl are up 40% since 2020. It takes a DROP of this drug to kill a young American.   Cartels are smuggling in 1000+ pounds per MONTH. Biden suspended the issuance of Notice to Appears (NTAs) for illegals that have been apprehended by CBP.   They break our laws, are given a plane ticket and an envelope of cash, and are then released into the United States. The morale of our brave Customs and Border Patrol agents has been crushed.  We don't have a Southern Border. More than 2 million illegals crossed the border in 2021. 2 million…that's 10 times the city of Birmingham. #SOTU Inflation has reached a 40 year high.  When @POTUS took office JUST OVER A YEAR AGO, inflation was below 2%. Inflation is now 7.5%. Inflation devastates Americas middle-class. The average household is now spending $3000+ more per year on basic goods and services. #SOTU @POTUS pushed to give $80 BILLION to the IRS to hire more agents to snoop in Americans business.   THIS AMOUNTS TO TENS OF THOUSANDS MORE IRS AGENTS. The same IRS that has repeatedly targeted Christian-conservatives and leaked confidential information of American taxpayers. The same IRS that wanted banks to report every transaction of $600 or more by individuals.   Every vacation with your family, wedding dress for your daughter, gun purchase for your son, Christmas gift for your parents…every transaction of $600 or more reported to the IRS. #SOTU @POTUS REFUSED to listen to the commanders on the ground in #<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. His judgement led to a disastrous pullout that wasted 20 years of American sacrifice and billions and billions of taxpayer dollars. His judgement handed <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>, including our military bases and equipment, over to the Taliban. And there are STILL Americans stranded in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. #SOTU @POTUS's top Education official sought false testimony against PARENTS, likening them to domestic TERRORISTS, and weaponized the FBI to silence critics of liberal school boards. @SecCardona solicited the National School Boards Association letter…which led to a Department of Justice memo issued to the FBI that directed the FBI to address “unruly parents.”   These PARENTS were called “domestic terrorists” for criticizing THEIR KIDS school board. #SOTU @POTUS did not, in fact, “shut down the virus”.  In July, Biden said we would celebrate our independence from the virus…only to immediately reverse course during the Delta wave and reinstate all kinds of pointless mask and vaccine mandates which did NOT follow the science. Biden spent money appropriated for vaccines and therapeutics on the border crisis (after making it worse).  Then, he dropped the ball on purchasing and distributing monoclonal antibodies…rationing them instead of treating the sick that could've been saved immediately. #SOTU @POTUS is considering allowing “safe injection sites”.   This would create a safe haven for people to use heroin and other narcotics with protections against fatal overdoses. @POTUS has also made “mail order abortion” permanent with agency action through the FDA. #SOTU @POTUS promised to work to re-open schools in his first 100 days, but his administration secretly worked with Teachers Unions to keep schools closed.  We recently found out that the CDC regularly communicated with a prominent teachers' union that was lobbying AGAINST reopening. Remote learning became the “new normal” and forced many students to stay in online school longer than needed. This hurt low-income students the most. The “American Rescue Plan” was passed a year ago, but the majority of money for K-12 schools still hasn't been spent. Now, the Biden administration is trying to take back congressionally appropriated funds unless states comply with their ridiculous COVID policies. And instead of prioritizing clear guidance to schools while reopening, the Biden administration chose to promote a radical, anti-American curriculum…including a handbook urging teachers to ‘disrupt whiteness and other forms of oppression'. #SOTU</em>”</p>
