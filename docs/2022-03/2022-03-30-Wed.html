If not, his failure to disclose income from right-wing organizations, recuse himself from matters involving his wife, and his vote to block the Jan 6th commission from key information must be investigated and could serve as grounds for impeachment.</span></a> 2. instead of your GUILTY President Joe Biden.  Biden should be impeached or have the decency to resign bc of his failure to secure the border, abandoning Americans &amp; arming terrorists <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Taliban</span> government, and for abuse of power &amp; being compromised by Hunter's business deals. 3. Joe Biden's family should care enough about his severe mental decline in his late stage of life on the world stage, and urge him to resign before his mental incompetence leads America into WW3.   It's utterly painful to watch and embarrassing for all of us. 4. But go ahead @AOC  Keep lecturing the American people, who you can't relate to bc you are really a spoiled brat who looks down on the regular hard working people of our country that are FED UP with the whining &amp; lies of the DC bubble, about why they should ONLY CARE about J6. 5. Seriously, demand that the American people who watched &amp; were victims of Democrats funded and supported BLM criminal rioters night after night, day after day, in the city streets of America for a year, why they should care so much more about you. 6. You literally trained and encouraged people how to “protest” on your social media as well as in person and sent mobs into city streets that ravaged and looted and burned private businesses and attacked police.  Yeah we have those post. 7. Now on behalf of all your friends in the Democrat Party, ActBlue, and BLM please go ahead &amp; explain to the poor people that live in the cities that suffered over $2 BILLION in BLM riot damages, why ALL THAT MONEY raised didn't help rebuild those communities you all destroyed. 8. Do black lives really matter anymore?   You and your Democrat friends and the media obviously don't think so.  Amazing how all of a sudden using black peoples skin color isn't the current Democrat political tool anymore, yet black people are suffering worse now… 9. in the communities destroyed by BLM violence and destruction funded by Democrats and promoted by the media.  “Mostly peaceful protest.”  Now black Americans and ALL Americans can hardly afford gas and food because of your incredibly stupid policies. 10. And NO the answer isn't just suck it up and buy an electric vehicle powered by Communist China's batteries and eat Bill Gates' disgusting fake meat.  You really should get out of the echo chambers of the out of touch think tanks filled with arrogant fools. 11. Your problem @AOC is that you are incapable of understanding how hard it is to make ends meet, when the government is ruining the ability to pursue life, liberty, and happiness by ripping our freedoms away and destroying our economy.  Because you have never actually done it. 12. Big government oppressive rules, regulations, and non stop bailouts are choking our businesses, job market, and making it extremely difficult for American people and families to thrive.  Massive debt &amp; the Feds failed monetary policies are destroying the value of our dollar. 13. making everyone poorer and creating an economic crisis that will hurt all of us, including your voters.  But the real danger all of us are in is the one that your president is putting us in.  You see meddling in regime change and divisive economic sanctions have consequences. 14. @AOC you are from a NYC district, but I'm from a rural district.  With farmers.  I invite you to come down to Georgia and talk with local GA farmers and get a good lesson about how food is grown, resources needed, and the cost it takes for the farm to successfully yield. 15. Then I'd like to take you to meet the trucking companies that sends their trucks and truck drivers to your district bringing the food into the city that has no farmland to grow their own food.  I know you look down on truckers, but… 16. you should really hear from truck drivers and trucking companies how badly the out of control cost of fuel is hurting them.  And how they say if the cost of fuel continues to rise, they won't be able to drive their trucks and deliver food &amp; needed supplies to places like NYC. 17. So while you think tweeting stupid lies about Clarence Thomas is what real Americans think Congress should be focused on, you actually show the entire world how amazingly out of touch you really are.  Congress should get it's act together and fix this broken nation. 18. And for someone like you who wants a long career in politics, which requires getting voted back in office, you should start caring more about the massive real life problems hurting Americans right now.  And the very deadly consequences of your energy killing policies. 19. The wind doesn't blow enough and the sun doesn't shine everyday &amp; everywhere to produce enough power to sustain the energy needs of our country.  Americans don't want to rely on Communist China's batteries to drive.  Your voters aren't going to like the future your creating.</em>”</p>
