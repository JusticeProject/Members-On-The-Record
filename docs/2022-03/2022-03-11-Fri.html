Helping working families w/ the cost of living, creating American jobs, &amp; making investments in our infrastructure &amp; institutions are essential to creating better future for all Americans. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepTedDeutch/status/1502287099583774726/photo/1">Link to image</a> I'm proud that the omnibus included priorities I've championed in Congress.  This bill invests in mental health &amp; infrastructure in our district, increases nonprofit security grant program funds, replenishes funding for <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>'s Iron Dome, &amp; provides aid for Ukraine. We've come so far to manage the coronavirus, but we must keep going to prevent future pandemics and keep Americans safe and healthy.  That's why @HouseDemocrats are making health care more affordable by investing in the services Americans need most. The climate crisis demands action and critical investments into science-backed solutions.  @HouseDemocrats' government funding legislation invests in the affordable, clean, and secure American energy that are crucial to combatting climate change and its impact on our communities. As we celebrate #WomensHistoryMonth, it's essential we build upon the contributions of women by ensuring their rights &amp; livelihoods are protected.  The omnibus will help crack down on gender-based violence with a long-overdue reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The omnibus also includes a bill I introduced w/ my colleagues, the Seniors Fraud Prevention Act, to keep our seniors from being targeted by scammers who wish to steal their assets.  I look forward to seeing all of these provisions pass in the Senate &amp; head to @POTUS' desk.</em>”</p>

Omar's Statement on Suspending Energy Imports from Russia Act: <a href="https://twitter.com/Ilhan/status/1501987360338239492/photo/1">Link to image</a> I opposed the Suspending Energy Imports from Russia Act, a bill that mandates a complete ban on Russian oil imports. The President clearly already has the authority to take this step - evident in that President Biden announced such a ban yesterday. (1) But putting the specifics into statute with no sunset and no conditions for lifting the ban creates a dangerous scenario, one in which we are taking today's policy question and making it tomorrow's political question. (2) The last time Congress passed significant trade restrictions on Russia was the Jackson-Vanik Amendment of 1974. Like this bill, it was motivated by genuine concern for human rights and human security. (3) It was not repealed until 2012, more than 20 years after the fall of the Soviet Union, well after its usefulness had expired. I have serious concerns that the Suspending Energy Imports from Russia Act... (4) will become yet another clear example where a policy stays on the books well past its utility because the political will to lift it has never materialized. (5) One thing that is very clear is that our dependance on oil means a dependence on tyrants, and this has always been true. There is no meaningful principle at play in a decision to ban Russian oil but seek it from <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia instead. (6) I am also gravely concerned that this ban will mean ramping up domestic oil production. Yet another reason why we must move to a green economy that is proven to be the most reliable and cost efficient.

Transferring Migs to #Ukraine is no different than the weapons we are sending.. 3) Yet we OPENLY state what we will NOT do, and allow Putin to say what he MIGHT do.  He has illegally contested the airspace of #Ukraine and we have been invited to stop that by the legitimate owners of the sky, but we may have to shoot down a Russian jet.  Yep.. 4) But that will be Putins decision.  If he is willing to use a nuke, he will if Ukraine beats him.  Should we then allow him to march everywhere he wants?  Or is there a point where we stand.  Maybe it is an attack on a NATO member… 5) and I have no doubt we would respond.  But, it's worth debating maybe the best time to stop this is when he is on his heals, now, before he can rearm and regroup.  After he threatened nukes we cancelled a regularly scheduled ICBM test.  Why? 6) what better message to appear unfazed than to remind of our capabilities?  Why don't the #Ukrainians have anti-ship missiles to inflict cost on ships and defend against amphibious landings?  Why don't we say, TODAY, that the use of WMB is a declaration of war against humanity 7) i do believe we have done a lot, and the administration should be commended for that.  But it's time to remember that our military with NATO cannot be defeated by Russia.  It's time to say that, and it's time to be clear that Putin can go no further.  Long live Ukraine./ PS… i was called a war monger 6 months before we attacked <span class="MOTR_Keyword">ISIS</span>, when i was the first member of congress to call for that.
