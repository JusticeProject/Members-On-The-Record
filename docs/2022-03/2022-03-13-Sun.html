(7/13) Go all the way, not half the way, on sanctions.  Sanction all of Putin's banks, not some of his banks.  Sanction all of Putin's economy, not part of his economy. (8/13) Freeze and seize Putin's $600 billion war chest -- currency reserves the Central Bank of Russia amassed in recent years that's allowing them to ride out the sanctions storm. Gold reserves are part of this slush fund that Putin built up in anticipation of sanctions. (9/13) Impose a full financial embargo and completely ban all foreign investment in Russia. Fully sanction any country, any business, or any individual who directly or indirectly engages in any business transaction with Russia. (10/13) Immediately commence a war crimes investigation into Putin at the ICC. Have the State Department designate the Putin regime as a state sponsor of terrorism. (11/13) Your administration is what is holding all of this back, out of fear of ‚Äúescalation‚Äù and ‚Äúprovoking‚Äù Putin. Please understand that what is most provocative is the weakness your Administration is demonstrating. Putin will never stop until he's stopped. (12/13) Hasn't Putin already provoked and escalated beyond belief by invading a peaceful sovereign nation and slaughtering its innocent civilians? How many more people need to die? How heinous must these atrocities get before we demonstrate the courage to end this genocide? (13/13)</em>‚Äù</p>
