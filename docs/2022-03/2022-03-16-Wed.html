New drilling leases won't produce oil for years. The only way they can get prices down now is to use the ones they have. I would also support a tax on oil company windfall revenues, to fund direct rebates to consumers. I'm not OK with asking working Americans to sacrifice in a national security crisis while asking nothing of oil companies making record profits. It's also time to tell Saudi Arabia - the only country in the world capable of quickly boosting global oil supplies - to increase production, and remind them that the troops we station to protect their Kingdom don't have to be there (as Trump once did).  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-trump-saudi-specialreport/special-report-trump-told-saudi-cut-oil-supply-or-lose-u-s-military-support-sources-idUSKBN22C1V4">Special Report: Trump told Saudi: Cut oil supply or lose U.S. military support - sources | Reuters</a> Finally, let's recognize that no matter how much oil we drill in the U.S., oil cartel countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>, Venezuela will still set the price.
