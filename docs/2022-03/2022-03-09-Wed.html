The one big change Biden made was to pause new leases on public lands. But only 10% of U.S. drilling happens on public lands. And new leases take years before oil is produced. <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisMurphyCT/status/1501405031328739329/photo/1">Link to image</a> 3/ Also, oil companies already have thousands of leases for drilling on public lands that THEY AREN'T USING.   There are lots of reasons for this (COVID recession, oil/gas prices too low to justify expense of drilling), but Joe Biden isn't one of them. <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/oil-gas-industry-stockpiled-drilling-leases-before-biden-pause">Oil, Gas Industry Stockpiled Drilling Leases Before Biden ‘Pause'... | news.bloomberglaw.com</a> 4/ I'll be charitable here and post a super uncompelling American Petroleum Institute's blog piece giving their side of the story for why all these public lands leases are sitting idle while they complain that Biden won't give them new ones.  <a href="https://www.api.org/news-policy-and-issues/blog/2022/03/04/the-red-herring-of-unused-leases">API   | The Red Herring of Unused Leases</a> 5/ U.S. oil producers don't want you to know this, but they have lots of non-Biden reasons to keep production low.  And even if they increased production, the price is oil is global, so a little more U.S. production won't really change prices here. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/02/energy/us-oil-production/index.html">More oil supply could stop massive price spikes. But US producers won't fill that gap... | cnn.com</a> 6/ Finally, remember that much of the oil and gas we produce here doesn't even stay in America.   In 2020, America produced 18M barrels/day and exported nearly half of that. Why? Partly b/c American refiners are designed to handle <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span>, not U.S. crude. <a href="https://www.fsmetals.com/about-us/blog/americas-light-sweet-problem">America's Light Sweet Problem... | fsmetals.com</a> 7/ But also, because U.S. producers sell to whoever pays the best prices. They make decisions on price, not patriotism.  Republicans don't want you know this either, but historically lots of U.S. oil goes to....wait for it...CHINA. <a href="https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/US-Oil-Exports-To-China-Soar-139-In-July.html">U.S. Oil Exports To China Soar 139% In July | OilPrice.com</a> 8/ And the oil companies don't lack capital. Chevron made $15 billion in profit in 2021. Their profit is bigger than the entire federal budget of over half of the world's countries.  Oil companies COULD invest more in U.S. production if they wanted.  <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chevron-rakes-in-15-6-billion-in-annual-profits-as-oil-prices-climb-11643370301">Chevron Rakes in $15.6 Billion in Annual Profits as Oil Prices Climb - WSJ</a> 9/ The bottom line is that American producers will ramp up oil production when prices are high enough, not when American national security requires it.  And Biden's policies don't explain the industry's decision making. The Ukraine crisis is just an excuse to drive up profits.</em>”</p>
