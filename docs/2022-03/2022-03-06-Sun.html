His account of the atrocities on the ground are heart-wrenching. The Russian military is targeting the civilian population on purpose, including assassinating government officials. Russian military personnel are storming apartment buildings, places of worship, power plants, universities, international dormitories, and kindergartens, killing innocent people and taking hostages. As a result, fifty children have been killed by the Russian military and the Holy Dormition Cathedral in Kharkiv has been shelled. Some Russian military units, including Chechen units, have turned into death squads, targeting Zelensky, his family, and other Ukrainian officials, including the mayor of Hostomel who was tortured and killed. Of the fifteen nuclear power plants in Ukraine, Russian forces have already captured two, are closing in on a third, to cause potentially a major ecological disaster in Europe. And in an unbelievable, hypocritical move, Russian ordinance have struck the sacred ground of Babi Yar where a memorial stands to remember the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Jewish</span> people who were massacred there by Nazi Germany. How is this an army fighting so-called “nazification?” President Zelensky also said that it is important for us to provide Ukraine with the military equipment they need to defend themselves and that our sanctions are working-- Russians in the business community are starting to speak up, Vladimir Putin has lost his standing amongst his colleagues and Ukraine has put up and incredible fight. But President Zelensky also underlined that we need to do more to support Ukraine. President Zelensky emphasized that Vladimir Putin is closing all independent media and we need Russians to understand what is happening in Ukraine. Specifically, I agree with President Zelensky that the U.S., the EU, and NATO should immediately provide the following support: 1) more lethal aid, including immediately transferring air defense systems, aircraft, and small arms, and 2) increased sanctions, including cutting of all Mastercard and Visa credit card transactions in Russia and beginning to implement a complete embargo on all US imports of Russian oil. These policy changes are essential in this moment, and I will be communicating this directly to the Biden administration. We are entering a critical time that will dictate the future of international peace and security. We must stand united with the Ukrainian people. My faith is with the Ukrainian people and I wish to see a peaceful end to this conflict as quickly as possible. Slava Ukrayini! Heroyam Slava!</em>”</p>
