I truly believe we need an American Revival and it's going to take all of us.  In one week, I spoke to a group of Democrat Union workers, I was on a podcast with a Grammy award winning hip hop and pop producer, I spoke at AFPAC, and then I spoke on a panel at CPAC.  1/13 2. I gave the same consistent America First message at every event to everyone regardless of their identity or ideology.   I said nothing wrong and have always denounced racism and anti-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span>, always will.  Evil hateful statements are not America First and don't belong. 3. All this week some of the very people that complain and say they are against people being canceled by Big Tech and the left want me to be the one to cancel people I've already said I disagree with on any and all racism and anti-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span>.  I follow Christ and he spoke to all. 4. The media went into hyper mode to rub more fake smears across my face with their lies in the headlines and truth in the last paragraph tactics, but never even asked my district's GOP chair for a comment.  They don't care what people think, they want to control what they think. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1499773286217039873/photo/1">Link to image</a> 5. Washington is in an extreme state of disconnect from real America, on both sides of the aisle, and it's why our country is failing.  The Washington machine is drunk on power and low on common sense.  And Twitter is far far left of Main Street America.  <a href="https://newschannel9.com/news/local/georgia-district-gives-input-on-if-they-have-confidence-in-marjorie-taylor-greene">Georgia district gives input on if they have confidence in Marjorie Taylor Greene... | newschannel9.com</a> 6. While the press run around the Capitol all day hearing my every word and analyzing every syllable in my speeches, they know more than anyone I'm not all the ‚Äòisms of hate they have worked so hard to try to make the public believe.  Their hypocrisy is screaming. 7. When celebrities, like @jimmykimmel, Howard Stern and Joy Behar, and left wing politicians, like former Democrat Governor Ralph Northam and Canada's dictator Justin Trudeau, have wore black face in the past. In Northman's case, it might have been a white hood. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1499773371567026185/video/1">Link to video</a> 8. This behavior is beyond the pale, but you never see the rabid fake news media hold them accountable until the end of time like they do with Republicans. 9. While Kimmel calls me ‚ÄúKlan Mom,‚Äù you don't hear anyone demanding he apologize to me.   But he and the rest of the  left wing mob, do owe me an apology because you'll never find a photo of me in black face or a recording of me saying the N-word like him.   I've never done it. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMTG/status/1499773400210116609/video/1">Link to video</a> 10. When you hurt people, it's right to apologize.  You have to accept responsibility when you do wrong.   That's what I've done in the past and what every mature adult should do.  Yet the left and some on the right apply a double standard. 11. Our priority focus all of us should have at this time is praying that God protects all of us from descending into WW3.   We must seek wisdom and use discernment to see the truth and make careful decisions. 12. Most importantly, we all must unify to return to policies that strengthen America and remove our dependence on foreign countries that want to defeat us.   Washington insiders and media need to learn an important lesson. 13. Stop acting like a bunch of high schoolers creating drama and spreading gossip that real Americans care nothing about.  And learn to take the crisis we are in seriously for all of our sakes.  Our future is at stake, and we are all in the same boat.  It's time to row together.</em>‚Äù</p>
