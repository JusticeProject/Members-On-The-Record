This is why I have voted against sanctions on Russia.   Sanctions will only push other countries together and away from the U.S. causing our dollar to crash, massive hyperinflation, and an economic crisis like America has never seen.  Sanctions won't stop war in Ukraine. 3. Other countries have grown tired of America's rules and foreign policies.  They are deciding that they don't need us even if we are paying them to be our friends.  And war in Ukraine is a convenient cover up for Biden family &amp; other's corruption in energy companies in Ukraine. 4. Pride comes before the fall.  This is a fall that shouldn't take place and if it does it will cause a great reset that will bring unimaginable human suffering.  Food famines, energy crisis, and tremendous loss.  And likely war on a much bigger scale. 5. The solution is to urge Zelensky and Putin to seek peace and have a seat at the negotiating table.  Not more funding for war and more sanctions that push Russia, India, Venezuela, SA, UAE, and other countries into the arms of China to trade on the Yuan instead of the Dollar. 6. The wise choice for America is for us to care about our own people's suffering with inflation, rapidly rising unaffordable gas prices, high crime, deadly border, and a moral crisis ruining our children's minds &amp; stealing their souls.  Save America before it's too late.</em>‚Äù</p>

In 2002, as an activist, I sent out a petition that got 1000s of signatures to call attention to the consequences of war on women &amp; oppose the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> war. Ukrainian women today are experiencing this again w/courage &amp; strength.   <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/16/ukraines-mothers-are-the-heart-of-the-war/?utm_source=PostUp&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Editors%20Picks%20OC&utm_term=40409&tpcc=Editors%20Picks%20OC">Ukraine's Single Mothers Forced to Become Refugees Are the Heart of the War | foreignpolicy.com</a> 2. Let's also remember the courage of women non-violent resistors in places like Sudan &amp; in war-torn places around the world who provided strength &amp; moral courage in refusing to engage in violence &amp; play enormous roles in ending war. <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/africa-in-focus/2022/03/03/the-women-of-sudan-will-not-accept-setbacks/">The women of Sudan will not accept setbacks... | brookings.edu</a> 3. The original petition, just as real today and why I am committed every day here as a Member of Congress and chair of @USProgressives to do all I can to prevent war &amp; emphasize diplomacy and de-escalation. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJayapal/status/1505206072633528323/photo/1">Link to image</a></em>‚Äù</p>
