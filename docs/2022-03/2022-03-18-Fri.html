All had worked for or with the U.S. &amp; all were in danger because of their connection to us. 5/14 Over almost 2 weeks, we worked around the clock with folks across the globe to get these Afghans into a convoy of rented busses, through 28 hours trying to get past dangerous Taliban checkpoints, into the airport, onto charter flights &amp; to safety out of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. 6/14 Through a few amazing coincidences and connections, the Afghans were welcomed to Albania, where the government generously agreed to host them. The Foreign Minister @xhacka_olta  met them on the tarmac, along with @USAmbAlbania Yuri Kim, who did so much to make it happen. 7/14 A wonderful NGO, @SpiritAmerica Worldwide, covered their expenses &amp; cared for them as a group. I am deeply indebted to them &amp; the Government of Albania for welcoming these Afghans in, on extremely short notice, &amp; serving as refuge in their time of need.  8/14 In November, I led a bipartisan codel to Albania to meet with many in this group. My trip coincided with a similar trip by @SenJoniErnst &amp; we traveled together to visit the Afghans. It's no exaggeration to say that this was one of the most moving experiences of my career. 9/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1504623747814367237/photo/1">Link to image</a> They asked us, quite simply, not to forget them. What I told them was this: I could not forget them, because I saw in each of them the faces of my grandparents &amp; great-grandparents who, many years ago, left their home countries for a safer &amp; more prosperous life in the U.S. 10/14 When we returned to DC, Senator Ernst &amp; I got dozens of members of the House and Senate, both Democrat &amp; Republican, to sign a letter lobbying the White House to vet &amp; let these Afghans - who risked so much for us - start a life in the U.S. 11/14 In December, I met with senior White House officials who, along with @SecMayorkas, Deputy Secretary John Tien &amp; State Department staff, helped arrange for thorough vetting of the Afghans, &amp; processed them for Temporary Protected Status here.  12/14 And next week, they will arrive at Dulles airport. From there, they will be placed in the cities where they have the strongest ties. 13/14 In all my years working in war zones, there are few things I'm more proud of than helping these men, women &amp; children get a new lease on life. It won't be easy, but I can't wait to greet them as they take their first steps in the country I love &amp; that has given me so much. 14/14</em>”</p>
