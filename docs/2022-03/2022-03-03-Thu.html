I look forward to hearing from the people of #NE02.   Call (855) 920-0558 to ask a question or listen LIVE at <a href="https://bacon.house.gov/live/">Live | U.S. Representative Don Bacon</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepDonBacon/status/1499174757224222722/photo/1">Link to image</a> Putin is saying "might makes right." He is a bully and a thug. We need to work with our NATO allies and work together to deter Russian aggression and stand against Putin. The US will give Russia $70M today to purchase their oil‚Ä¶ we will be doing this everyday until we decide to stop buying their energy exports. We must sanction Russian energy and cut off their main source of income. Last night, the President spoke on how to address the environment &amp; energy. However, he completely failed to address that increasing America's energy production &amp; natural gas infrastructure would help regain America's energy independence and counter Russia's energy exports. Q: Russian Oil A: We've gone backwards in energy production his past year‚Äîwe've become a net importer, and gas prices have gone up [‚Ä¶] We will have to increase our production again and cut Russian exports, and the rest of the world can accommodate. Q: Infrastructure A: Nebraska will receive about $2.5B to maintain and repair roads and highways...including $216M for two programs that provide low-interest loans for building or improving water &amp; wastewater systems. It was also based on per-capita. Q: Renaming Bases A: We have 10 bases named after confederate generals..some affiliated w/ the KKK. I don't think it's appropriate. I suggested renaming a base after Fort Benavidez, a soldier who was wounded 31 times while rescuing 8 fellow soldiers. He is a TRUE American hero. Q: Energy Independence A: Many bases in Europe use Russian gas. If you remove their energy, these bases will struggle. We should not be dependent on them. [‚Ä¶] POTUS' EO cancelling the Keystone XL Pipeline cost thousands of US jobs &amp; increased the safety risk of transporting fuel Q: <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> A: I deployed four times to the Middle East. This is personal to me. [‚Ä¶] We've been providing a ton of air power to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. We trained Afghan pilots and they were doing a good job. But the withdraw moved our pilots/mechanics. Q: <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> (pt2) A: The President called this a ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù and he had no regrets. We lost 13 servicemen. Thousands of lives lost and interpreters are still being hunted down. They were owed better by this. Our adversaries are emboldened. Putin&amp; Xi are watching. Q: <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> (pt3) A: The President also failed to address this last night. This was NOT a success. This was a strategic failure. Q: Ukraine A: Bullies don't stop unless they get scared. We need to continue helping Ukraine and giving them the tools they need to fight, but I've been impressed with their pride and bravery. For decades they've been fighting and preserving their freedom and independence. Q: Inflation A: Last March, we passed the $1.9T COVID bill. We were warned that it would trigger inflation. We added about 10% to the money supply with no way to pay it. Larry Summers also warned us about BBB. Congress has to REIGN IN spending &amp; stop the massive deficit spending. Q: Medicare A: I agree that we should be able to negotiate these prices. It takes too long to get generic drugs on the market. We have the best research for pharmaceutical research‚Ä¶however Americans pay for this. We need to do better with this and help more people. Q: Climate Solutions A: No matter your views, we want to leave a better world for the next generation. I supported the wind/solar tax credits. Carbon capture technologies and battery storage are vital to improving our environment. Energy independence is top priority. Q: Securing Elections A: The Constitution protects state's election laws. I voted against H.R. 1 which would federally fund congressional campaigns and cost the taxpayer billions of dollars. I believe Nebraska's elections were accurate, but we can always push for more security. Q: What will get our country back on track? A: Inflation is the #1 issue. We have to get spending under control. Before COVID, our pay was increasing faster than inflation. We also need to look at increasing jobs in the trades. These are outstanding jobs. Q: What will get our country back on track? (pt2) A: The Biden Admin talks very little about trade. We need to fight to open trade doors back up and fight for our farmers and ag producers. We also need to maintain the tax code that helps us compete with other countries. Q: GI Benefits Bill A: There is a disparity between how the Guard and Reserves are treated. There has been pushback, but I sided with our guards and reserves on this issue. I value their service &amp; what they do for the US. There needs to be parity when it comes to these benefits. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1499198837260525574">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@RepDonBacon You talked very little about trade from 2017-2020 when the leader of your party was waging an unnecessary and expensive trade war</span></a> @CRagole BS‚Ä¶ I was big supporter of USMCA.</em>‚Äù</p>
