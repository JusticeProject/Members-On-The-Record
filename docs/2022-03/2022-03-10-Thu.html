President Zelenskyy asked members of the House &amp; Senate on Saturday for, among many things, help with evening the odds in the skies above Ukraine. 2/12 We should be scouring former Warsaw Pact states for more anti-aircraft weapons, including legacy Russian equipment &amp; associated munitions *and* step up our deliveries of proven systems like Stingers, Javelins, MANPADS &amp; NLAWs. 3/12 Mi-17s &amp; drones from countries like <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Turkey</span> that give the Ukrainians some ability to compete in the skies or move troops and resources to support the fight are critical as well. 4/12 We also need to strengthen our defensive capabilities within NATO countries by continuing to send advanced equipment, like the air &amp; missile defense systems announced today, to enhance our posture. 5/12 Putin must understand that if he tests NATO, he will hit steel. Our steps should include more frequent combat air patrols with our allies to demonstrate that we will defend NATO's borders. This is not escalation ‚Äì this is us defending our fences. 6/12 On the economic front, we need to ratchet up our economic sanctions beyond what's been announced. Right now, only a handful of banks have been cut from SWIFT ‚Äì it's not enough. 7/12 We need to sever all major Russian financial institutions from SWIFT &amp; double-down to make sure Moscow can't weasel around sanctions through cryptocurrencies or gold. 8/12 When it comes to the oligarchs, freezing assets is fine; seizing them is better. The Germans &amp; French have gotten the ball rolling, but it's time for the U.S. &amp; others to do the same, especially the British, given London's long standing role as a hub for dirty Russian cash. 9/12 It's also time to target politicians in Ukraine who have declared their support for Putin's aggressive actions and who could be tapped to lead a puppet regime installed by the Kremlin. 10/12 Finally, while we supported the administration's request for nearly $4 billion in humanitarian aid for Ukraine and &amp; the surrounding region, we haven't heard their plan to take in refugees, or even allow family members of Americans to temporarily come &amp; stay in the U.S. 11/12 We have a moral obligation to help these innocent men &amp; women whose lives have been destroyed by Putin.

This bill doesn't do a THING to open up American oil and gas production.    It does give $14.1 billion to Biden's Department of Interior, which has not conducted A SINGLE onshore federal oil and gas lease sale this year.   <a href="https://www.energyindepth.org/one-year-later-biden-administration-still-hasnt-held-onshore-lease-sales/?154">One Year Later: Biden Administration Still Hasn't Held Onshore Lease Sales | energyindepth.org</a> This provision completely prohibits oil and gas production in a specific area in New Mexico.

These organizations are directly responsible for the disastrous Paris Climate Agreement. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepChipRoy/status/1501702775989747724/photo/1">Link to image</a> Of course, this bill funds the left's woke agenda.   It ups K-12 education funding by $2 BILLION to $42.6 billion.   This money will subsidize school districts throughout the country that are teaching CRT and radical gender ideology.  <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/07/14/california-school-district-mandates-ethnic-studies-course-based-on-crt/">California school district mandates 'ethnic studies' course based on CRT | nypost.com</a> It also provides a total of $10.1 billion to an FBI that actively targeted parents for speaking out against woke school boards.  <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/03/04/states-sue-biden-admin-over-fbi-surveillance-of-parents-protesting-school-boards/">States sue Biden admin over FBI surveillance of parents protesting school boards | nypost.com</a> Speaking of radical gender ideology, there is a specific program that would expand the scope of the Violence Against WOMEN Act (VAWA) by providing services to ‚Äútransgender‚Äù individuals. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepChipRoy/status/1501702783308906498/photo/1">Link to image</a> This is not a joke ‚Äì it actually provides taxpayer dollars to fund GENDER PROGRAMS IN <span class="MOTR_Keyword">PAKISTAN</span>. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepChipRoy/status/1501702786664312836/photo/1">Link to image</a> It increases funding for the Department of Homeland Security by 11%.

No one should be forced to choose between a taking jab or losing their job‚Ä¶ The bill also attacks the Second Amendment.   VAWA seeks to open criminal investigations into anyone who receives a NICS denial (90%+ of which are false positives!).

Here are 10 actions the US can take to support Ukraine:  üßµüßµüßµ 1. Coordinate a global embargo on Russian oil, while maximizing existing domestic and OPEC production to backfill supply. 2. Increase diplomatic pressure on Beijing to distance itself from the Kremlin, including consideration of secondary sanctions on Sino-Russian financial &amp; commodities ties. 3. Work with NATO allies to increase the supply of airplanes, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">drone</span>s, anti-tank, anti-aircraft, and anti-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">drone</span> weapons and training to Ukrainian forces, for the duration of the conflict. 4. Wage deniable, surgical cyber-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">attack</span>s on Russian command and control and logistics nodes within Ukraine. 5. Expand information operations designed to demoralize Russian troops in Ukraine. 6. Plan with Ukraine, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and/or Slovakia to host Ukrainian training facilities and a government-in-exile if needed. Use Article 4 consultations to assuage their security concerns. 7. Issue a statement from NATO clarifying the Russian actions that would trigger Article 5, to avoid inadvertent escalation. 8. Backchannel to the Kremlin that NATO would not wage cyber-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">attack</span>s in the Russian homeland unless Russia cyber<span class="MOTR_Keyword">attack</span>s NATO first. 9. Insist that all Ukrainian forces, whether organized or guerilla, be recognized as combatants and that atrocities against civilians will lead to prosecution against the Kremlin security elite, including the president, at The Hague. 10. Present an off-ramp for President Putin by indicating that (a) NATO will still engage in security talks with him and (b) on-the-ground progress towards a sovereign, secure, and democratic Ukraine will lead to calibrated sanctions relief.</em>‚Äù</p>
