It is being led by politicians &amp; businesses who's only interest is throwing $ at US producers.  Let's dive in: 1/ First, we - and by we, I mean the entire Western, pro-democracy world - should do everything in our power to reduce demand for Russian oil &amp; gas.  Their economy depends on it. 2/ The best way to do that is to commit to energy efficiency and renewables.  It gives us all access to transportation, warm homes and electricity with the least cost.  And makes us dependent not only on Russian oil, but also <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span>, Azerbaijani, Canadian and North Dakotan. 3/ Alternatively, we could get there by shifting production elsewhere.  And this is where the conversation gets dangerous.  Because lots of my colleagues are suggesting this is about Keystone, or ramping up US LNG exports.  THEY ARE LYING. 4/ Some numbers.  Nordstream 2 has the capacity to 55 billion cubic meters/year of natural gas to Western Europe.  Total US LNG export capacity is about 121 BCM/y, but it's almost totally maxed out.  We are already using that resource as much as we can. 5/ We are facing real time, daily risks of Russia taking control of Ukraine.    I'm going to say this slowly for the kids in the back of the room: YOU CAN'T BUILD AN LNG TERMINAL IN A WEEK.  Arguments that US should ramp LNG exports right now are moronic. 6/ Moreover, the build up of LNG export capacity has substantially contributed to the rising price of natural gas in the US.  Setting moral issues aside, anyone arguing for more LNG exports is also arguing for more volatility in US natural gas markets.  <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1450931410987069444?s=20&t=nAANcAYL-7VnltJWEnij0w">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">And now, I bring you a public service announcement to pre-but the arguments that seem to be gaining traction suggesting (falsely) that current gas price volatility is caused by renewables.  Buckle up... Thread:</span></a> 7/ There is another argument going on that the US should immediately permit the Keystone pipeline and stop purchasing Russian oil.  Let's look at those numbers: 8/ The US is importing about 13 million barrels of Russian oil per month.  (400K BPD).  This is primarily to Alaska and Hawaii, for geographic reasons.  <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MTTIM_NUS-NRS_1&f=M">U.S. Imports from Russia of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products (Thousand Barrels)... | eia.gov</a> &nbsp; <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1498705998546190336/photo/1">Link to image</a></em>‚Äù</p>
