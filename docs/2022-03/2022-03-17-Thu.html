I get it.  The prices are too damn high.  There are many reasons for the sky-high prices, and one of the most pernicious: Price gouging. It must end.  I'll explain why. Russia is the third-largest producer of oil in the world.  Last week, President Biden and Congress banned Russian oil and gas, delivering another blow to Putin's war machine.  That means our supply is down, so prices go up at home.  But that's only half the story. Would you believe me if I said the price of a barrel of oil actually plummeted in the last week?  It's down to less than $100 a barrel. Last time it was that low a gallon of gas was about $3.62.  But that decline may not materialize at the pump.  Why? One word: Profiteering. Oil companies are cashing in on a global humanitarian crisis.  The American people are willing to pay a bit more at the pump in solidarity with Ukraine.  But that doesn't make it okay for oil companies to rip off their customers. So we've got to call them out.  And fill the void of Russian energy with green, renewable sources.  We can turn this challenge into an opportunity to climate-proof the country.  So we aren't beholden to the Russians, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span>s, Venezuelans, or other petro-dictatorships.  Ever again.</em>‚Äù</p>
