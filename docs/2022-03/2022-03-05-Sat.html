President Trump understood this basic principle, which is why in 2019, the United States became a net total energy exporter for the first time since the 1950s. Unfortunately, since taking office last year, the Biden Administration instead pushed a Green New Deal agenda, which is exactly what Vladimir Putin hoped would happen. This has destroyed our energy independence, eradicated well-paying American jobs, and forced American consumers to rely on tyrannical regimes like those in Russia and <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span> for vital supplies of oil and natural gas. Not only does American energy independence protect our national security, it creates high-quality American jobs and supports domestic industry production that is cleaner than energy produced elsewhere. Anti-energy policies from Democrats in Washington and Albany have hamstrung our communities, and now we are paying the dire price.  Democrats and green activists have played right into Putin's hand. Here in upstate New York, the Utica Shale remains inaccessible due to self-defeating Democrat policies. Now, amidst the unprecedented backdrop of Vladimir Putin's unprovoked war on a sovereign nation, we can, and should, pursue safe natural gas exploration in upstate New York. In addition, the Biden Administration must restart construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and re-open federal lands to oil and gas exploration to drive down prices at the pump</em>‚Äù</p>

But please stop pretending this is a silver bullet, or that we could somehow "replace" all the Russian oil by drilling in America.  Please follow along for a few facts . . . 1/ <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1498847944245755907">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">What part of the speech will Biden announce we are going to replace #oil from #Russia with oil from America?</span></a> Last year, the US bought $17 billion worth of oil from Russia. That's not a huge number, and many US refiners are already ending their purchases anyway.  In comparison, Biden's sanctions cost Russian energy companies over $190 billion just this week. 2/ <a href="https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/Russian-Oil-Gas-Giants-Lose-95-of-Their-Market-Cap-On-London-Exchange.html">Russian Oil & Gas Giants Lose 95% of Their Market Cap On London Exchange | OilPrice.com</a> If we really wanted to deny Putin oil revenue, we'd try to stop all his oil and gas exports, not just the puny ones to the U.S.  But Russia is the world's #2 oil exporter -- second only to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia. Taking all that oil off the market overnight would explode gas prices. 3/ Republicans have been arguing that we could make up for losing Russian energy by stopping "Biden's war on oil" at home.   Huh?  In fact, there are 248 more active oil and gas rigs in the US today than when Biden took office, a 62% increase. 4/ <a href="https://rigcount.bakerhughes.com/">Rig Count Overview & Summary Count | Baker Hughes Rig Count</a> Meanwhile, Biden is approving oil and gas drilling permits on public lands at a faster rate than Trump, and has been criticized for it by environmental groups. 5/ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/06/biden-is-approving-more-oil-gas-drilling-permits-public-lands-than-trump-analysis-finds/">Biden is approving more oil and gas drilling permits on public lands than Trump, analysis finds - The Washington Post</a> If on top of all that, you also want to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, know that it wouldn't produce oil till 2031. The Keystone Pipeline also would take years to come online.  These projects would have no impact on gas prices today. 6/ <a href="https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/anwr.php">Link to eia.gov</a> If you want to shield American gas consumers from the impact of Russia's war, your problem is not Biden; it's <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Crown Prince MBS. This supposed US ally could produce more oil today but refuses, to protect a production agreement he made with Putin! 7/ <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/saudi-arabia-chooses-putin-over-biden-ukraine-keep-oil-prices-high"><span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia Chooses Putin over Biden on Ukraine to Keep Oil Prices High... | wilsoncenter.org</a> Back to politics: many Republicans privately admit we can't "replace" all the Russian oil, but they want Biden to ban it all anyway, and then criticize him for the inevitable increase in gas prices.  We can't afford that kind of cynical partisanship right now. 8/ Democrats and Republicans need to lock arms and say: "As we sanction Russian oil, we must increase oil &amp; gas production in the short run (including by pressuring the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span>s). But there will still be sacrifice at home, and we agree freedom and security are worth the price." 9/ And let's agree that so long as we are dependent on oil, every country that influences its price can blackmail us.   Let's become the world's clean energy superpower, and tell Putin, MBS, and the leader of every other "gas station masquerading as a country" to go to hell. End/</em>‚Äù</p>
