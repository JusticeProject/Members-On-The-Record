Time &amp; again, the Ukrainians have demonstrated a remarkable will to fight, which is just as important as arms or training. 1/ <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/CNN/status/1627708213230436376">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">President Joe Biden made an unannounced visit to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Watch his whole speech here: (Watch President Biden's full speech from surprise visit to Kyiv | CNN)</span></a> But without outside support and unity, it's fair to say it would have been much harder for them to turn back the tide of a nationwide invasion; a short war of attrition would have likely given way to occupation, and strong insurgency. Without unity around sanctions, Russia would have significantly more money to resupply, train and purchase weapons, instead of relying on second-rate powers like <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span> to supply their drone program. Without security assistance and humanitarian aid, the Ukrainian economy would have been at risk of collapse, and the refugee crisis would have seen millions more in Europe and beyond, and without any hope of going home. Putin would have likely tried to walk the streets of an occupied Kyiv to demonstrate success. Instead, today, President Biden was there honoring the sacrifice of the Ukrainian people. A failure to act would've been felt widely outside of Ukraine, with higher costs than what we have spent thus far — grain never would've been harvested or left Ukraine, causing an international food crisis, untenable inflation, and instability or state collapse in other places. The nearby Baltic counties, NATO allies so physically close to Russia, would have rightly assumed that they could be next and could have called for the NATO alliance to formally prepare to defend them. Any action Putin could have taken to further threaten Europe could have triggered Article 5 consultations, setting NATO on a collision course with Russia and the very real possibility of outright war, with the U.S. expected to be the lead actor. An unabated take over of Ukraine and aggression towards NATO could have started a spiral of escalation that could have led to American sons and daughters fighting a nuclear state. So when the reflections begin on what we have spent in Ukraine, it is just as important to realize how much more in blood and treasure we would have had to spend if we had sat on our hands. Last summer I traveled to Kyiv to meet with President Zelenskyy &amp; see firsthand what the Ukrainians could do with the weapons we've provided. From holding the line outside Kyiv to reclaiming territory across the East, they've accomplished much, but there is still more to do. I know that for some Americans this conflict has faded into the background, but for the sake of the Ukrainian people, our Allies in NATO, and the cost to the US, it's critical that we continue to maintain the system we built at the end of WWII. That system, girded by American leadership, isn't perfect — but it's the one that has kept us from major world wars for 70+ years.</em>”</p>
