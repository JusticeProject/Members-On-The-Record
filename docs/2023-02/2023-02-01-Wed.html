Just how bad have things gotten?   1.2 million migrants have evaded law enforcement since Joe Biden became president. We don't know who they are or where they are, but they are here.🧵 29-year-old Alireza Heidari was just arrested by Texas DPS at our Southern border last week.   He's reportedly an <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>ian national on the terror watchlist. There were 98 terror watch lists arrests in Fiscal Year 22, a massive spike from previous years - in FY19, there were 0. I commend Texas DPS and US Border Patrol for their heroic efforts to apprehend these terrorists. But law enforcement is simply overwhelmed. The Biden admin's failure to fully enforce the law or secure the border is encouraging a migrant influx that is simply too great to contain. Since October of last year, there have already been 300,000 illegal immigrants who have evaded law enforcement. Again, these individuals are in our country - we do not know who they are or where they are. In FY22, there were an estimated 600,000 known gotaways total. And let's be clear, the government is probably UNDERESTIMATING the number of gotaways, meaning it could be even higher...much higher.   All told, under Joe Biden, there have been AT LEAST 1.2 million gotaways. This is greater than the population of at least nine states. Despite the fact that nearly 3 out of every 10 migrants attempting to enter our country in FY22 evaded law enforcement, President Biden and Democrats in Congress have FAILED to meaningfully boost spending for border enforcement. Instead, President Biden has fought to end Title 42, a policy that enables us to expedite the removal of illegal immigrants. Reports suggest that ending Title 42 would increase the surge at the border, yet it continues to be a priority for Joe Biden. Joe Biden has been derelict in his duty to respond to this national security crisis. Let's be very clear: he is president. It is because of his inaction that 1.2 million migrants have evaded law enforcement, entering our country illegally without a trace. In summary:   - Joe Biden has overseen the worst migrant crisis in our nation's modern history. - Under his watch, 1.2 million migrants have evaded law enforcement. - Instead of addressing the crisis, he supports policies that would make it even worse.  It's time to impeach.</em>”</p>
