During the last Congress, he showed respect and civility to me and to all of the members on this committee. I have every intention of doing the same and appreciate all we accomplished together last Congress.” “This committee is actually even older than our country. HFAC was first established during the Continental Congress &amp; its 1st chairman was Benjamin Franklin - who was notorious for establishing strong diplomatic ties with our allies – many of whom remain our allies still today.” “Chairman Engel often said, when it comes to foreign policy, partisanship stops at the water's edge. That's bc [HFAC] deals w/issues of war &amp; peace. HFAC has never been more relevant w/ the global challenges &amp; threats we face from our foreign adversaries.” “In the wake of a Chinese surveillance balloon traversing our country – crossing over national security assets and threatening the privacy of Americans – it is clear we must start our work with confronting the China challenge with substantive actions.” “We need to ensure Ukraine has the tools it needs to defeat Russia's army. Not just because it's the morally right thing to do in the face of the horrific war crimes Russia is committing in Ukraine. But it's also because a Russian loss is a victory for U.S. national security.” “For almost 2 weeks we watched one horrific scene after another playing out on TV &amp; culminating in the Abbey Gate bombing. We lost 13 U.S. servicemembers on that day, w/ dozens wounded in that attack. It was the deadliest day for the U.S. military in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> since 2011.” “Our committee also has jurisdiction over the root causes of migration. President Trump helped to secure the border, but with the stroke of a pen President Biden undid his good work. Now, the border is worse than I have ever seen it in my lifetime.” WATCH📺 CHM @RepMcCaul's full opening remarks here⬇️ <a href="https://youtu.be/JMj7Ogxahs0">Chairman McCaul's Opening Remarks at HFAC Committee Organizational Meeting... | youtu.be</a></em>”</p>
