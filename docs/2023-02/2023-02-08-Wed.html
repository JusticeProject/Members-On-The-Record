Excited to have @realbencarson as my guest tonight for the SOTU. Ahead of President Biden's remarks, I wanted to share some thoughts of my own on the state of our union. To quote my friend @RepBarryMoore, ‚ÄúWe've become broke, woke, and an international joke.‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623106906402193413/photo/1">Link to image</a> First, let's take a look at what Biden inherited from President Trump. Democrats' unlimited spending has ramped up inflation to record highs. Under Trump, the average inflation rate was 1.91%. Since Biden took office, inflation reached a 40-year high of 9.02%. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623106913788362752/photo/1">Link to image</a> What about gas prices? During President Trump's four years, the average price of gas was $2.57. When Biden took office, it was $2.62. Under the Biden Administration, gas hit $5.10 last June. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623106930234228738/photo/1">Link to image</a> This spending is why I introduced H.R. 812, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2023, and am committed to stopping wasteful spending like the nearly $2 Trillion (with a T!) Democrats rammed down our throats through the American Rescue Plan that not a single Republican supported. While the entire bill was garbage, I wanted to highlight a few egregious examples of government waste. The Biden Administration wasted money on the following: üí∏ $783.5 Million in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks to prisoners, including the Boston Bomber. üè® $140 Million for Broward County, Florida, to build a 29-story ‚Äúluxury hotel.‚Äù $50,000 to the Northern Mariana Islands to ‚Äúteach Indigenous canoe-building and explore pre-colonial sea life.‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623106947477012480/photo/1">Link to image</a> üáØüáµ $98 Million to Japanese citizens living in Japan in the form of $1,400 stimulus checks. üßÑ$225,000 in Fresno county, CA to promote the first ever ‚ÄúNational Garlic Festival.‚Äù üé£ $7 Million for the state of Alaska for ‚Äúsocial-media influencers to promote the state's famous seafood.‚Äù <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623106957237256192/photo/1">Link to image</a> The list goes on and on (and on)! <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623106964128514050/photo/1">Link to image</a> What about the 87,000 IRS agents the President hired? Earlier this week, the @IRSnews announced a "Service Industry Tip Compliance Agreement" program designed to "improve tip reporting compliance." So much for only going after the "billionaires." <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623106971158052864/photo/1">Link to image</a> It is clear President Biden, and his radical left administration is wrecking our economy. But what about our country's position on the international stage? The Biden Administration has left a path of destruction on almost every foreign policy issue it has touched. We went from President Trump orchestrating peace in the Middle East under the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Abraham</span> <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Accord</span>s to President Biden leaving behind our allies and $7 Billion (with a B) in military equipment in Afghanistan. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/politics/afghan-weapons-left-behind/index.html">First on CNN: US left behind $7 billion of military equipment in Afghanistan after 2021 withdrawal, Pentagon report says | CNN Politics</a> President Biden's weakness has left us vulnerable to attacks from China. In the literal sense, the Biden Administration just let a Chinese surveillance balloon fly over our country for eight days before making the decision to shoot it down. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623106976082190339/photo/1">Link to image</a> This disastrous lack of leadership has only emboldened our enemies. Putin has continued to wage a war of terror in Ukraine. For that alone, our country has committed more than $24.9 Billion (with a B!) in taxpayer funding to war efforts. How about the southern border? And our Border Czar @VP? So far, she has only made one trip to the border (which, by the way, is not secure). <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623106985141862400/photo/1">Link to image</a> <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Accord</span>ing to @CBP, in FY22 there were an estimated 2,378,944 Southwest Land Border Encounters, representing a 37.1% year-over-year increase. CBP reports 717,660 encounters this fiscal year alone through the end of December. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623107005975080960/photo/1">Link to image</a> Additionally, in FY22,  a record 14,700,000 pounds of fentanyl were seized at our borders and points of entry. <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Accord</span>ing to the CDC, in 2022, an estimated 110,236 people died in a single 12-month period from overdoses. Also, remember when @POTUS made sure to fund crack pipe distribution programs? Riiiight. See @PatrickHauf  <a href="https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/biden-admin-to-fund-crack-pipe-distribution-to-advance-racial-equity/">Biden Admin To Fund Crack Pipe Distribution To Advance 'Racial Equity'... | freebeacon.com</a> But there is hope. Republicans in the House and Senate are committed to delivering on turning the ship around. That's why I'm grateful we fought for a rules package that will deliver hope for the American people. The American people gave @HouseGOP a mandate, and I'm grateful to be working for a stronger future. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepOgles/status/1623107018650275840/photo/1">Link to image</a></em>‚Äù</p>

It does no work inside the United States. Its focus is on competing with foreign propaganda abroad. 3/ Most importantly, Musk seems to claim that the GEC made claims about him personally. I can find no evidence that this is true, and the long @mtaibbi thread he links to doesn't make that claim either. 4/ The Taibbi thread seems to suggest the at GEC improperly labeled social media accounts as "Russian propaganda" just because the accounts spread false information about COVID.  If that's what Taibbi is saying, it's also not true. 5/ All the GEC did was was to note that bots and social media accounts that had previously been proven to be linked to foreign governments were now in the business of spreading anti-U.S. COVID misinformation. That's it. 6/ re "media manipulation". The GEC produced a report showing that Russia/China/<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span> were spreading tons of COVID misinformation (like Bill Gates being responsible for the virus) as a means to hurt the U.S.  The GEC sent the report to the media. How is that "manipulation"? 7/ The GEC does great work to protect America. I have supported it no matter who was President (note that the report Musk complains about was released by the Trump GEC when it was led by a former Fox News analyst).

On the economy, Americans can't afford food and gas, the baby formula supply hit an all-time shortage, and wages failed to keep up with 40-year high inflation. On the World Stage, a Chinese spy balloon penetrated our airspace, the Taliban now controls <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>, and the open border has been flooded with over five million illegal immigrants. On energy, American independence was shattered, our oil reserves were severely drained, and the Keystone XL Pipeline construction was halted on Day 1. It's clear: Biden's words don't match his dismal, incompetent results. While the president misguides and misinforms the American people, House Republicans will remain busy keeping their promises and correcting his laundry list of failures.</em>‚Äù</p>
