Deadly chemicals are spreading far and wide through the air, ground water, and rivers like the Ohio River.  I don't think blame can be.. placed on one person or nefarious cause.  I think this is a tragedy that happened because we are a crumbling nation with many causes as to why we are crumbling.  And it's so sad for the innocent people affected by this terrible situation that will be affected for years to come. Train derailments have been happening more frequently than we realize, with an average of around 1,700 per year, &amp; very low casualties.  There many reasons trains derail.  Broken rails, collisions, mechanical/wheel failures, brake defects, and train handling just to make a few. But what's happening in East <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Palestine</span> is probably just the beginning of more tragic events that are likely to happen to us in our crumbling nation.  In the rail industry, they have been suffering from labor shortages that were exacerbated by covid shutdowns.  Especially.. the freight industry, which is a critical piece of our supply chain that delivers food, goods, chemicals, and fossil fuels in order for us all to survive.  With labor shortages, cutting the number of rail workers on trains, it creates potentially dangerous.. conditions for trains and railways.  The disruption in our economy and critical supply chain from covid shutdowns made these issues even worse.  And because of this, mega trains (very long trains) have become more common.  Operating mega trains with few workers has its problems. Braking can be difficult when operating long trains with a mix of empty cars (lighter weight) and loaded cars (heavier weight).  It can create an accordion like effect and creates a higher risk of derailment.  I don't know if this happened in East <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Palestine</span> but it happens. Our nation's rail system is a very critical part of our supply chain and the integrity of our railroad tracks and all of it's working components and gears must be maintained.  With labor shortages that can also be a difficult task and take longer to accomplish to be safe. But the issue we must face as a nation is why are we having labor shortages and how important it is to solve this very serious issue.  It's not just the rail industry facing nearly 20% labor shortages, it's MOST industries, and it shouldn't be this way. Not only do we have a shortage of people, we have a shortage of good values.  And hard work is one of the most important good values America is losing.  Or has lost.  Think about this.  How many kids do you hear say they want to be a train engineer when they grow up? How many kids do you hear say when they grow up they want to be police officers, firefighters, airplane pilots, ship captains, builders, farmers, electricians, lineman, truck drivers, soldiers, doctors, teachers, and any other necessary profession that a country needs to survive? If kids say it when they're 5 yrs old, our society's projected values change their minds by the time they're 18 yrs old.  Our society teaches them to want to either work as little as possible or to chase dreams they think will make them rich but are only attainable by very few. Many kids today think when they grow up they will be high paid professional athletes, music or movie stars, paid social media influencers, or will just easily land a six figure job bc they earned a college degree that put them in six figure debt.  In reality, very very few.. will ever become a professional athlete, music or movie star, or even relevant much less paid on social media.  And landing the big six figure job with a meaningless degree in reality will be a desperate job search resulting in less than $50K/year if they are lucky. But they will still have the six figure college debt they signed up for after they barely turned 18.  There are also many young Americans who spend their days dazed from using marijuana all day and unfortunately confused.  While some people use marijuana for medicinal reasons or PTSD, and some people say they are able to perform well while using marijuana, there are still some people who don't.  Not everyone can work or think very well while they are stoned all day, and for some it even creates more mental problems.  We aren't all the same folks. Just like alcohol impairs abilities so does marijuana.  And we should be teaching our kids and young adults that you have to take good care of yourself to be the best version of yourself and some one an employer wants to hire &amp; pay.  No one owes them anything &amp; nothing is free. The fact that kids and young adults don't know these things is not really their fault.  It's our fault, our society's fault, it's the adult's fault.  We should teach our children the truth and our education system should.. prepare them for reality, train real world skills, technology jobs, how to build, farm, pilot, invent, and most of all work hard physically and mentally.  If we want our kids to be successful and we want to rebuild our crumbling country, we need to invest in the next generation. The very real truth we have to face as a nation together outside of politics is many of our different industry experts, craftsman, and skilled technicians are retiring or soon to be retired.  We must prepare our younger generations to take their place &amp; save our crumbling nation.</em>‚Äù</p>
