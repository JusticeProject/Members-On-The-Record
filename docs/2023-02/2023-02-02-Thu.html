Removing her is a disservice to our national security and the American people. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/Ilhan/status/1620189526277726209">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">Our work on the House Foreign Affairs Committee has been about advancing human rights, holding government officials accountable for past harms, and advancing a more just and peaceful foreign policy. (Link to twitter.com)</span></a> Of course, under Speaker McCarthy's leadership, they have become the party of political stunts over public service. This motion is meant to appease his party's most extreme members. When I talk about extremism in the Republican Party, I'm talking about Members who spread antisemitic conspiracy theories and a former Pres. who dines with anti-Semites. For that party to accuse Congresswoman Omar of anti<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span> is at best hypocritical and at worst Islamophobic. This motion is merely the latest distraction from House Republicans, who will do anything to avoid governing OR holding their own members accountable for misconduct.</em>”</p>
