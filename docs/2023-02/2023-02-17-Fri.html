Tune in here ➡️ <a href="http://securityconference.org/en/msc-2023/agenda/">Agenda and Livestreams: Munich Security Conference 2023... | securityconference.org</a> "The United States and China must develop some relationship that allows for an arms control framework, comparable to what we were able to develop with the Soviet Union decades ago." "We have to take into account the Global South, and deterring nuclear use—whether by China, Russia, or any other state—will also have to take into account the voices of the many, many countries around the world that do not want to see nuclear weapons ever used." "As we imagine a new security architecture for climate, for pandemics, and for the nuclear threat, we have to include all the countries of the world—not just the handful that are nuclear armed." "The unimaginable—a global pandemic that kills millions, climate change reshaping our world—is happening. So we have to put on the menu of things which all of us should be more aware and engaged, the very real threat of the misuse or first use of nuclear weapons." "Putin's aggression really began clearly in 2008, and then in 2014, in a whole series of steps that did not get the forceful, unanimous, global response they deserved. That's how we're at this dangerous moment." "If Putin is successful, if in the end he grinds to a success... comparable to what's happened in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span> and Chechnya, and his nuclear saber rattling is a part of what has really deterred the West from being more aggressive in delivering advanced weapons systems..." "...then we've encouraged any nuclear state in the future to similarly threaten as a way to slow roll conventional conflict into battlefield success... That's part of the argument as to why it's critical that Putin not win and that Ukraine be victorious."</em>”</p>
