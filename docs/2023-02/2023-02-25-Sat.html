The insinuation was that because I'm gay, I want to ‚Äúindoctrinate‚Äù kids with sexual perversion. For a party that claims to hold the mantle of decency, they sure do hatred and division pretty well! (3/4) This is much bigger than holding a House seat -- it's about standing up to extremism and hate.
