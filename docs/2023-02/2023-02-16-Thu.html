One of the most comprehensive reports on that movements was issued by the CFTC in the Trump White House.  I recommend reading the whole thing.  <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/9-9-20%20Report%20of%20the%20Subcommittee%20on%20Climate-Related%20Market%20Risk%20-%20Managing%20Climate%20Risk%20in%20the%20U.S.%20Financial%20System%20for%20posting.pdf">Link to PDF | cftc.gov</a> 2/ Some of that movement is a flight away from risk.  Insurers raising premiums or simply refusing to cover property in flood- or extreme-weather prone regions.  Banks off-loading risk onto tax payers or less sophisticated players. 3/ Some of the movement is a flight to quality.  Oil company stocks trade at really low price/earnings ratios right now, especially compared with clean tech companies.  Investors in the former are stripping cash so they can reallocate to the latter. 4/ Gradual rebalancing is fine.  But for a sector has been so subsidized for so long, they've lost the muscle memory to adapt to markets.  The transition for them, their investors, their employees and their host communities/countries is not gradual. <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/climate-change/energy-subsidies">Fossil Fuel Subsidies... | imf.org</a> 5/ A country, or a region that has all their jobs dependent on an industry that can't compete, can't attract capital and is exposed to a rapidly changing climate (think gulf coast US and flooding, or <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span> and heat waves) has very little room to gracefully maneuver. 6/ Go too slowly and markets will destroy you.  Move too quickly and politics will destroy you.  The glide path for political leaders in both places favors kick-the-can cowardice.  Which is the worst possible path, but it's the one too much of the world has been on. 7/ The World Bank matters because they have the ability to think longer term, to help ease that transition on both sides.  And when their leader demurred on climate change by saying "I'm not a scientist", it was a clear sign that he was entirely unfit for the job. 8/ That's why @RepHuffman and I, along with 25 of our colleagues called on the Biden administration to replace him last September.  And I'm glad that he is now stepping down.  <a href="https://casten.house.gov/media/press-releases/casten-huffman-lead-colleagues-calling-president-biden-remove-world-bank">Casten, Huffman Lead Colleagues in Calling on President Biden to Remove World Bank President Malpass | Representative Sean Casten</a> 9/ The next step is now critical.  In the words of the great Gina McCarthy (say this in your best Boston accent, please), "we've got no time for the deniers".  Let's get proper leadership in place at the World Bank while we still (barely) have time.  Onward.  /fin</em>‚Äù</p>
