As the only refugee and the only African-born member of Congress, and one of only a few Muslim members of Congress, she brings a unique and valuable perspective to this chamber. 🧵 As the Ranking Member of @EdWorkforceDems, I can personally attest to the commitment and critical contributions she has brought to that committee. It is undisputed that @Ilhan made a mistake with some of her previous comments. But she apologized when she learned that her words were hurtful and sought out members of the Jewish community to better understand how she could be an ally in the fight against anti<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span>. Her actions stand in stark contrast to similar situations involving members of the Majority party &amp; only underscores their incredible hypocrisy. @SpeakerMcCarthy and Majority Whip Emmer have both accused prominent Jewish Democrats of trying to buy elections &amp; control of Congress. Not only have they never apologized, as @Ilhan did, for engaging in the same antisemitic tropes, they were elevated to leadership positions within @HouseGOP. And let us not forget that former President Donald Trump just recently dined with two prominent antisemites. There is simply no comparison between today's vote removing @Ilhan w/ the bipartisan actions taken against Reps. Marjorie Taylor Green &amp; Paul Gosar.  Both of them were stripped of their committee assignments after they promoted violence against their colleagues in Congress. Instead of trying to punish members of congress that they do not like, I would invite House Republicans to join @HouseDemocrats in our efforts combat inflation, reduce costs for families and continue building on the economic progress we made over the last two years.</em>”</p>
