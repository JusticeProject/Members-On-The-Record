My key takeaways in thread below 👇 Bibi: Iran obtaining a nuclear weapon will "change history." Not only is it an existential threat to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> but it will spark a nuclear arms race across the region that is a mortal threat to the world. Bibi (cont.): Expanding the Abraham Accords will be a "quantum leap" for peace, will bring several more countries into normalization w <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> &amp; will be the catalyst needed for negotiations w Palestinians. Vague answers to our questions on how, &amp; if, he proceeds w judicial reform. King Abdullah: Jordan remains a critical partner in the region for US diplomacy &amp; counterterrorism. Their economy is in a difficult place. King Abdullah (cont.): Jordan's likely to join the UAE &amp; Saudi in pulling Assad back into the Arab League as a hedge against Iran though the King would like more concessions in return such as Assad stemming the exploding drug trade that is devastating Jordanian youth. President el-Sisi: Frustrated with the int'l community on Sudan. Egypt already has 4.5M refugees &amp; is accepting more. The key to Sudan is stopping regional actors from backing either side and causing a regional proxy war. President el-Sisi (cont.): With the war in Ukraine cutting off wheat &amp; global inflation, Egypt's economy is very precarious. Cooperation w <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> on Gaza issues remains strong. President el-Sisi (cont.): He repeatedly asked if the Middle East is better off post Arab Spring w Libya, Sudan, Yemen, Lebanon, Syria, &amp; Iraq in open civil war or destabilized. Palestinian Authority: Hamas &amp; Iran are advancing their position in the West Bank. The PA could be heading for collapse under current financial restrictions from <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> &amp; unpopularity w people. Palestinian Authority (cont.): They remain committed to non-violence but must have something to show for it—namely a pathway to some resolution to their final status as a state.</em>”</p>
