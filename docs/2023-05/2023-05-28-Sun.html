He passed away in 2020 from toxic exposure after serving his country most honorably. 1/12 <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMarcyKaptur/status/1662545425214193665/photo/1">Link to image</a> Last Congress we passed legislation named in his memory, The Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022, known as The PACT Act for short. 2/12 <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMarcyKaptur/status/1662545429588738048/photo/1">Link to image</a> The #PACTAct expanded and extended eligibility for VA health care for Veterans with toxic exposures and Veterans of the Vietnam, Gulf War, and post-9/11 eras. 3/12 This week @AppropsDems were initially faced with extreme legislation that would defund the Toxic Exposure Fund by over $14 Billion. The vital #PACTACT legislation is already signed into law, but now at risk of being defunded and weakened by @HouseAppropsGOP proposals. 4/12 Let us not forget, Congress created the toxic exposure fund on a bipartisan basis to ensure those servicemembers and veterans impacted by burn pits are not left behind ‚Äî now, or ever. 5/12 I served on @VetAffairsDems last Congress, when Republicans and Democrats worked together to pass the the #PACTAct. I also know the complicated health struggles Heath faced having spent much time with his mother-in-law, @SusanZeier of Sandusky, Ohio. 6/12 <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMarcyKaptur/status/1662545437558030337/photo/1">Link to image</a> My constituent Susan is a fierce advocate who was instrumental in fighting for the PACT Act's success. Working together over the years to pass this monumental legislation, I met with countless veterans and their families who similar to Heath were impacted by toxic exposure. 7/12 <a href="https://twitter.com/RepMarcyKaptur/status/1662545441592934404/photo/1">Link to image</a> Knowing how Heath could have benefited from the #PACTAct, I simply cannot stay quiet while the @HouseGOP try to dismantle and defund imperative veterans' benefits like this as a tactic to cut costs. Cutting screening and treatment for our veterans isn't a way to cut costs. 8/12 For those brave servicemembers who have heroically returned to the homeland ‚Äî but carry with them the injuries of toxic exposure ‚Äî America has an obligation to make good on President Lincoln's command to care for those who have borne the battle. 9/12 Fully funding the #PACTAct should be a priority for Republicans, and I will continue to ensure that our veterans who have sacrificed so much for the preservation of freedom are delivered the care and healing they so rightfully deserve. 10/12 Democrats remain united to support our United States military, and all troops who return home. The @HouseGOP mustn't turn their backs on our promise and commitment to those who have so faithfully and courageously served us all, however their current proposal does just that. 11/12 To learn more about the #PACTAct's extended and expanded @DeptVetAffairs health care and benefits for millions of toxic exposed Veterans and their survivors ‚Äì including many Vietnam era, Gulf War era, and Post-9/11 Veterans you can go to <a href="http://VA.Gov/PACT">The PACT Act and your VA benefits | Veterans Affairs</a>. 12/12</em>‚Äù</p>
