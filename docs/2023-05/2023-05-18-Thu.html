As the violence rages and conditions worsen by the day, 25 million people ‚Äì more than half of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Sudan</span>'s population ‚Äì desperately need assistance. Earlier this month, I led my colleagues in pushing for more U.S.-led efforts to secure humanitarian aid access as part of the ceasefire negotiations. This need is even more critical today. <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=D4574822-E924-46BD-9365-5B8180DDC314">As Violence Persists, Warner, Kaine, Colleagues Call for Increased Humanitarian Access and Assistance for <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Sudan</span>... | warner.senate.gov</a> The violence so far has left hundreds dead, thousands more injured, and displaced more than one million people. The country's health care system has collapsed, and the indiscriminate nature of the violence has severely degraded critical civilian infrastructure. Let's be clear ‚Äì blame for these conditions and the disruptions to aid lie with the warring parties. Reported gross violations of international humanitarian law have greatly impacted the safety of aid personnel, and directly contribute to the suffering of the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Sudan</span>ese people. U.S. and internationally mediated efforts recently led to both sides agreeing to a set of principles to protect civilians and support humanitarian access. But establishment of a set of policies to put those principles into action is vital, as today, the violence continues. Senior U.S. official involvement ‚Äì including through a special envoy deployed to the region ‚Äì is critical in facilitating direct negotiations between the sides and regional/international partners, and ensuring the involvement of civil society. I'm also concerned about¬†ensuring that¬†<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Sudan</span>ese nationals living here in the U.S. would not be forced to return to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Sudan</span> amid this violence.
