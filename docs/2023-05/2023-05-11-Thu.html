No American journalist should ever fear retaliation, imprisonment or death for simply doing their jobs. As we acknowledge this somber occasion, I renew my calls to action. We must pass the Justice for <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Shireen</span> Act and the Justice for Journalists Act to protect journalism at home and abroad. Together, we can honor <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Shireen</span>'s life and legacy, and preserve freedom of the press¬†for generations to come.</em>‚Äù</p>
