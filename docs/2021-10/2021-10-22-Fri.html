What he revealed was disturbing. 🧵⬇️ <a href="https://t.co/rK38bT85id">Link to photo</a> Grossi confirmed that while the Iran Deal was in place and before the U.S. withdrew, Iran failed to declare locations where nuclear material had been present in violation of the agreement and attempted to conceal that noncompliance. Iran also failed to provide the necessary explanation for the presence of nuclear material &amp; impeded IAEA’s access to the locations. IAEA found evidence of use &amp; storage of nuclear material &amp;/or conduct of nuclear-related activities in at least 3 undeclared locations in Iran. Grossi said that IAEA’s “additional protocol” for undeclared nuclear activity was applied only “provisionally” &amp; “voluntarily” under the Iran Deal. This means that under the Iran Deal, Iran wasn’t required to answer questions about the undeclared sites or give IAEA fulsome or timely access to these sites. Grossi’s testimony underscores the fatal flaws in the Iran Deal. It did not have the teeth to hold Iran accountable, it failed to give the the IAEA unfettered access to undeclared sites in a timely manner consistent w/ its additional protocols. Furthermore, it did not punish Iran for its noncompliance. President Trump was right to leave the Iran Nuclear Deal!</em>”</p>
