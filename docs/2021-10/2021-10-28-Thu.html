And I want to thank the incredible Peace Corps volunteers ‚Äì especially those from my home state of Texas ‚Äì who have selflessly given their time to do good work abroad. "But the agency still has work to do. Tragically, the number of volunteers reporting sexual assault during their service has risen...I look forward to hearing from Acting Director Spahn about the work the Peace Corps is doing to quickly correct these issues. "As the #CCP ratchets up its malign influence tactics around the world, it‚Äôs critical this committee ensures the DFC is fulfilling its development mandate, while furthering the national security interests of the United States. "The MCC has built a great reputation on its ability to hold our partners to a high standard of accountability. But I‚Äôm concerned by the scope of its recent climate commitments.
