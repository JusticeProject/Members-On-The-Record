While Democrats are fussing with each other over how much more money they can tax you &amp; spy on your bank account, China is testing nuclear space missiles, little rocket man is launching rockets, and our border is wide open with the biggest organized caravan in history coming. 2. The world is laughing at us because Biden, Kamala, and Pelosi are being controlled by the Hate-America Communists (Progressives) who are running their party.  While Dem’s Trump Derangement Syndrome is still out of control, these morons are running our country in the ground. 3. Even Democrat voters are hiding their heads in shame saying “what have we done?”  In 9 short months, what a freaking disaster we are in while Democrats are now showing us all their Communist membership cards!  Even worse, they are just pathetically incompetent.  What a joke! 4. #BuildBackBetter is actually out of control inflation, skyrocketing crime, impending supply chain disaster, &amp; economic conditions ripe for collapse.   Build Back Better turns your boys into girls, segregates children by race, &amp; Marxist School Boards report parents to the FBI. 5. #BuildBackBetter means America’s military wants soyboy soldiers &amp; not masculine men, instead of wiping out an unnecessary draft they draft your daughters, and mandate unwanted vaccines for all while demoralizing our troops and arming Islamic terrorist nations. 6. #BuildBackBetter means America goes from being energy independent and having an abundance of oil reserves under Trump to depending on China for our forced “green energy needs” and Biden begging OPEC to drill more oil to gouge Americans at the gas pump. 7. #BuildBackBetter means while Democrat members of Congress defund police Hamas terrorist sympathizer Democrat Congresswoman Ilhan Omar blames out of control crime and lawlessness in the streets on police, instead of the criminals actually committing the crimes. 8. It’s time for every American to wake up and realize that #BuildBackBetter really means:  #DestroyDivideDemoralize  It’s time to take a stand against the Democrat Communist Takeover and put #AmericaFirst!</em>”</p>
