He missed it – just like last year.   My colleagues and I sent a letter to the WH demanding answers for how the President's budget will address the crises he has created for the American people. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1490740293414666241/photo/1">Link to image</a> President Biden's FY23 budget must get serious about the highest inflation in 40 years.   @USCBO found that inflation in rural areas was 130% of urban areas. It's harder for rural Americans to pay the price for Democrats' reckless spending. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1490740297218863106/photo/1">Link to image</a> Former Obama economic advisor Larry Summers repeatedly warned Democrats reckless spending would ignite inflation.  What's the Democrats' solution to the inflation crisis? A $5 trillion spending bill they want Americans to believe is the cure for inflation. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1490740300939157507/photo/1">Link to image</a> Given Congress has already enacted $6 trillion in COVID spending, will the President's FY 2023 budget include a request for yet more billions of dollars for so-called 'COVID-19 relief'? <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1490740304466620416/photo/1">Link to image</a> The Biden Admin has refused to commit to prohibiting U.S. funding for projects at the Wuhan Institute of Virology – even as China continues to stonewall efforts to discern the origin of COVID-19.   The President should commit to block such funding in his FY23 budget. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1490740307822059536/photo/1">Link to image</a> The President's FY23 budget must provide the resources &amp; policies needed to secure the border.    Biden's last budget flatlined funding for the Department of Homeland Security.   DHS has had to move money meant to pay Border Patrol agents to buy migrant child care items. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1490740312137941000/photo/1">Link to image</a> On his first day in office, President Biden signed an executive order canceling construction of the border wall.   Instead of securing the border, Biden is allowing $350M of unused border wall steel to rust away. Billions have been paid to contractors to babysit the steel. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1490740315942264840/photo/1">Link to image</a> The President's FY23 budget should ensure that no taxpayer dollars flow to the Taliban.   Given the Taliban's human rights record, no humanitarian aid from the UN can end up in the Taliban's pocket, including the $308M the U.S. has already sent to support the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span> people. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJasonSmith/status/1490740319289233412/photo/1">Link to image</a> If President Biden's next budget is any reflection of his first year, his Admin will continue to value reckless spending, record high consumer prices, a defenseless border, and the largest expansion of the federal government in half a century.</em>”</p>
