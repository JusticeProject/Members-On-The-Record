You may not know this name, I first learned it in 2014 working at the White House. This man masterminded the genocide against the Yazidi people on Sinjar Mountain.THREAD <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-special-forces-conduct-counterterrorism-mission-syria-pentagon-says-rcna14692">U.S. special forces conduct ‚Äòcounterterrorism mission' in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span>, Pentagon says... | nbcnews.com</a> I first knew Al-Qurayshi's name as Haji Abdullah. He gave orders to massacre the Yazidi people because of their faith. I'll never forget waiting outside the Oval Office late in the evening on August 6, 2014, upwards of 50,000 Yazidis sat trapped atop Sinjar Mountain. 2/14 I paced the West Wing thinking:  is this really happening? Men, women, children fled up the mountain, abandoned their cars like some apocalyptic movie. They had no water or food after fleeing ISIS fighters who sought to exterminate them.   Photo: Rodi Said/Reuters 3/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/AndyKimNJ/status/1489264687392825350/photo/1">Link to image</a> We were called into the Oval Office. We briefed the President that extermination could happen at any moment, either by starvation on top of this mountain or at the gun barrel of ISIS. This could be the single largest massacre since WWII. 4/14 They were clear: Al-Qurayshi said if the Yazidis didn't convert to Islam they would be killed on sight with women and children taken into enslavement. Thousands of girls would be kidnapped and turned into sex slaves, raped and forced into marriage. 5/14 <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2014/8/5/iraqi-yazidis-if-we-move-they-will-kill-us">Iraqi Yazidis: ‚ÄòIf we move they will kill us' | Humanitarian Crises News | Al Jazeera</a> President Obama, facing one of the toughest decisions of his Presidency, gave us the green light that night to begin a rescue mission. We quickly exited the Oval to get the operation going. Immediately, one C-17 and two C-130s were on their way deep into ISIS-held territory. 6/14 I sat in the Situation Room waiting for an update from the Pentagon as I worried that ISIS might try and shoot down our planes. I breathed a sigh of relief as soon as I heard that the drops were successful. 7/14 After only 36 hours of planning, three U.S. aircraft under the cover of darkness were able to drop 72 bundles of water and food within a drop zone the size of a football field along the spine of a mountain in the middle of a warzone. 8/14 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/us-aid-iraqi-trapped-mountain-isis">US carries out air drops to help Iraqis trapped on mountain by Isis | Iraq | The Guardian</a> But the threat wasn't over, this just bought us some time. Al-Qurayshi's forces were taking offensive positions around the mountain's base. The Iraqi army was still in complete shambles after the fall of Mosul. The Kurds had a few forces in the area we could work with. 9/14 We helped create a safe corridor down one side of the mountain while our aircraft targeted ISIS fighters around the perimeter. Tens of thousands of Yazidis safely got off Sinjar mountain. 10/14 But Al-Qurayshi's wrath turned to other villages throughout the region. He still captured and killed thousands and ushered in brutal violence that boosted his reputation within ISIS. After Al-Baghdadi was killed, ISIS named Al-Qurayshi their leader. 11/14 <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/world/middleeast/isis-al-baghdadi-dead.html">ISIS Names New Leader and Confirms al-Baghdadi's Death - The New York Times</a> Last night, under cover of darkness, brave US servicemembers risked everything to target Al-Qurayshi.

While we work to stop Al-Qurayshi and others from killing, we must recommit to helping those who survive.

I saw the same values that have always defined the men and women of the Guard ‚Äî an unmatched level of professionalism, a tireless work ethic, and unbreakable patriotism. 3/8 When called to contribute to Operation Allies Welcome, the Virginia National Guard showed what it means to serve ‚Äî taking on a massive logistical challenge, balancing competing missions, and delivering for thousands in need of safety and shelter.  All on short notice. 4/8 I want to thank them for their dedication and for keeping my office updated about the shifting security and medical needs at the facility.
