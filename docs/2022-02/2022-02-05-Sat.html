Telling people that the system is fine but an enemy must be repelled to preserve it is pretty good if the system unduly benefits you.  And too often, it works. 3/ It's the essence of every reactionary movement, from Trump to Putin to Orban.  And historic figures of much iller repute. 4/ But when we see it in another country, we treat it as a weird foreign thing. Which brings me to the NPR story this morning. 5/ I missed the intro, but when I got in my car they were talking about a group with radicalized leadership, disorganized, non-coordinated violent groups on their periphery and a populist majority who are not themselves violent but require absolution as a path to peace. 6/ They could have been talking about the @GOP at the national level. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/04/us/politics/republicans-jan-6-cheney-censure.html">G.O.P. Declares Jan. 6 Attack ‘Legitimate Political Discourse'... | nytimes.com</a> 7/ They could have been talking about how national @GOP rhetoric has infected our entire country and radicalized those peripheral groups they've lost control of.  <a href="https://capitolfax.com/2022/02/04/the-attacks-on-rep-deb-conroy-are-some-of-the-most-vile-and-revolting-things-i-have-ever-heard-and-read-in-my-entire-life/">CapitolFax.com... | capitolfax.com</a> 8/ They were, instead talking about <span class="MOTR_Keyword">ISIS</span>.  And it would be shocking to hear a news outlet talk about the @GOP that way.  But the drivers are the same. 9/ We are at a moment where massive wealth has been created in the US but has left behind too many.  You could look out for the good of the whole.  You could acknowledge our imperfections. You could strive for a better future for all. 10/ Or you could tell the downtrodden that their troubles are caused by people who don't look like them, don't pray like them, don't live near them and we must attack them for seeking equality of opportunity.  That rhetoric is at odds with democracy 11/ And it is, at core why it is so easy for their senior leadership to equate attacks on the Capitol with "legitimate political discourse".  Autocrats who benefit from a lop-sided system do not want a democracy, nor a meritocracy.  They want to preserve their status. 12/ This wasn't always the case.  Voting rights was overwhelmingly bipartisan in 2006.  Comprehensive immigration reform was championed by John McCain.  But today's @GOP ain't that. 13/ So let's find a way to say that.  And to recognize that  the marginalized who follow are not the sinners.  They are being victimized for evil ends.  We are, in the words of Elijah Cummings, better than this.  /fin</em>”</p>
