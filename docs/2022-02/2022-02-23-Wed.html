We also met with @BorisJohnson &amp; discussed the determination of allied nations to counter Russian aggression. Our delegation also held additional bilateral meetings with senior British leaders @TrussLiz &amp; @Keir_Starmer to discuss the importance of the NATO alliance &amp; transatlantic partnership, the COVID-19 response &amp; the imperative of transitioning to diversified green energy solutions. During our visit to London, President Putin further escalated his aggression against Ukraine. I applaud @POTUS for his forceful leadership today in imposing the first tranche of swift and severe sanctions.

(2/8) My colleagues and I urged @POTUS to impose crippling sanctions against Russia, halt the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, and repeal his Executive Orders that hindered our energy production and security giving Russia and our adversaries more leverage. (3/8) Deterrents should have been implemented either prior to the full buildup of Russian troops, or at minimum when the intelligence became clear that they planned to invade. (4/8) Making matters worse is that Europe has become increasingly dependent on Russian natural gas. This should serve as a great lesson to American politicians working overtime to eliminate our energy independence, and in turn, threaten our national security. (5/8) Sadly, until @POTUS and the Democrats recognize their domestic energy policy will take us down the same road of vulnerability as Europe, Americans will see further increases to gas, electricity, and heating costs.

As the situation evolves, I continue monitoring developments in the region. This is the time to stand with the Ukrainian people against this unprovoked &amp; undemocratic assault. In 2021, the Biden Admin waived sanctions on the Russian company building the Nord Stream 2 pipeline &amp; its Chief Executive. Just last month, Senate Democrats hypocritically used the filibuster to keep Nord Stream 2 pipeline sanctions from reaching the 60-vote margin for passage. The completion of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline would put many countries in Europe further under the thumb of the Russian government by making them more dependent on Russia for their energy needs, thus further emboldening Putin and his cronies. I am pleased that today, Germany halted the certification of Nord Stream 2. This is a positive development, but we need to project American leadership to counter Putin. The time is now to truly unleash Alaska ‚Äì and America's ‚Äì energy sector. There is no reason for America and our allies to rely on Russian energy exports when we can produce it right here at home. This week, President Biden finally announced sanctions against Russia, but why did it take so long? This is not only a crisis for freedom-loving people in Ukraine, but a test for our nation. Unfortunately, President Biden waited for Putin to be breathing down Ukraine's neck before taking action. Other adversaries like China, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>, and North Korea are watching. They are taking notes on how we respond, which is why we must firmly and decisively stand up to Putin in defense of Ukrainian sovereignty.</em>‚Äù</p>
