That is not language that we have used and will not use. (Link to twitter.com)</span></a> Several of the report's policy recommendations, which include ending all US security assistance for Israel and promoting the “right of return” for Palestinian refugees, would threaten Israel's existence. These aren't only harmful policy recommendations, but Amnesty International appears to be going out of its way to lobby countries to end their support for Israel. I don't support that, nor do the bulk of my constituents, nor does this Congress. We should not forget, American security assistance, for items such as the Iron Dome missile defense system, protects Jewish and Muslim lives alike. And the bulk of the aid is utilized to defend against foreign attack. Amnesty International plays an important role around the world, and civil society needs to be supported and nurtured. But it is clear that even the title of the report is intended to be more inflammatory than a report from Amnesty should aspire to be. The extensive #humanrights reporting about the plight of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza cannot be overlooked. Demolitions, settlement expansion, arbitrary detentions, harassment and other injustices can and must end. But, issuing such an inflammatory report - which makes no effort to explain the challenges Israel faces, or the history of the Jewish people - does not do justice in seeking real solutions to the conflict. As Chairman, I have traveled to Israel and the West Bank and have met with Israelis and Palestinians young and old, rich and poor. I have met Israel's new government, as well as Palestinian Authority leadership. They both have an enormous amount of work to do. A two state solution is the only way to assure that both peoples are provided the freedom, security and justice they deserve. I think Amnesty International report, due to its purposefully inciteful nature, doesn't help that effort.</em>”</p>
