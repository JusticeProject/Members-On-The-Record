That's exactly what happened over the weekend when they decided to limit Russia's access to SWIFT. It's a start, but too many Russian banks are not effectively sanctioned. Secondary sanctions would force the world to decide between doing business with Russia or the U.S. by blocking from our economy any foreign bank that chooses to continue doing business with Russia. As our sanctions regime against <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span> illustrates, the world will choose the U.S. This would then entirely isolate Russian banks from the global economy—not just the U.S. economy—and shut down Russian oil and gas sales. While coordinating with our European allies is important, we can no longer wait on reaching a consensus with the EU before taking swift and severe action. America must step up and lead before Russian aggression escalates even further. I implore @POTUS to immediately impose sweeping secondary sanctions against Russia's entire financial sector and for Congress to pass the Never Yielding Europe's Territory Act to impose such sanctions—before more blood is shed.</em>”</p>
