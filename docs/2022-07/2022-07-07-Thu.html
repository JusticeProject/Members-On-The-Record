In one post-war letter, a family friend described his death as too terrible to put into writing. My family survived in part because of the grace of one person in particular, Father Jozef Czapran. A Catholic priest, he put himself at great personal risk by helping my family forge papers to hide their Jewish identity so my dad, just a toddler at the time, could survive. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepHoulahan/status/1544768003916562433/photo/1">Link to image</a> It was an honor to be present as Father Jozef Czapran was posthumously recognized as Righteous Among the Nations.
