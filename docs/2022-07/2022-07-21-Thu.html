Let's talk about what this means. üßµ The Office works to advance initiatives to achieve gender equality. When we talk about protecting <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span> women from Taliban retribution, this is what we're talking about. When we talk about breaking down barriers around education &amp; entrepreneurship for women ‚Äì this is that role. GOP members of the committee held this urgently needed nominee because either they don't understand the Office or they are so beholden to the anti-choice agenda seized by their party that they don't seem to care about what they are even opposing. GWI does not provide health care programming and there is no secret agenda. The obsession over controlling women's bodies has become so entrenched in GOP policies they cannot support basic, fundamental efforts to empower women. That is telling. They opposed a role meant to support women so they could pass a faux litmus test on abortion. Extreme party politics are seizing control of our urgent policy priorities and it has to stop. The lives &amp; safety of these women are more important than any talking point. The GOP should immediately stop this grandstanding which only further limits the ability of the U.S. to prioritize the health, safety, education and success of women in vulnerable nations. This is no time for ill-informed party politics.</em>‚Äù</p>
