It's great to see more partners make improvements. #Ireland made its first convictions in almost 10yrs, signaling an end to impunity for traffickers. The @StateDept is clearly playing fast &amp; loose with the #Burundi upgrade to Tier 2. Last year's upgrade to Tier 2 Watch List was misaligned with the realities on the ground.
