Despite this progress, the only lasting solution will be for Russia to end its invasion and for Ukraine to regain its territorial sovereignty. The United States, NATO, and the international community must continue to use every tool at our disposal to isolate Putin's regime, aid the Ukrainians defending their homeland, and hasten the end to this invasion.</em>‚Äù</p>
