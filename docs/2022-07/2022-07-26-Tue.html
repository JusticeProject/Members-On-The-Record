This decision is particularly egregious after DG Grossi described Iran's nuclear program as "galloping ahead" &amp; said in June that the IAEA would lose its understanding of the state of Iran's program if the cameras weren't restored in 3 or 4 weeks, a window that has since passed. Moreover, Iran also just declared that it will not answer the IAEA's outstanding questions about uranium particles found at undeclared nuclear sites in Iran, directly contradicting the censure resolution that was overwhelmingly passed by the IAEA Board of Governors last month. These announcements reflect Iran's dangerously escalatory nuclear behavior. I'm glad the US commitment to ensure that Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon was strengthened by the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Jerusalem</span> Declaration &amp; I urge continued action w/partners to ensure this commitment is realized.</em>‚Äù</p>

I also believe God's word in the Bible, which is about the people of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> and the gospel of Jesus Christ.  The Bible is filled with amazing and miraculous history, and I love it.  Cont'd The godless lying left has been lying about me from day one and calling me anti-semitic, racist, fascist, and even a Nazi, which are all absolutely disgusting lies about me.  But their problem is that most people see through their lies bc their empty words don't match the truth. Yes I'm a Christian. I'm not perfect, I'm a sinner, and I know I can't ever be perfect enough to go to heaven based on my acts alone. I need a savior and his name is Jesus.  Jesus says to love God and love people.  I'm also elected by Americans in Georgia's 14th district to serve as their Representative in Congress. I love my country and I'm grateful to serve the people who elected me, who are American citizens like me.  The conspiracy theories being told by the lying godless left are just desperate lies by people who know they are losing bc their policies are really policies of hate and failure to Americans.  Another reason they lie about me is they recognize my tenacity and know I'm resolved in my faith &amp; my commitment to America.  They can't beat me bc most Americans actually think a lot of the ways I do. Hopefully, this helps some of you that are brainwashed by liars like Rachel Maddow who by the way has never met me in her entire life and gets paid to lie about me by her hard left employers at MSNBC.
