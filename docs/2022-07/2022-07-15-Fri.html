I'm proud that the bill includes amendments I wrote or co-sponsored to protect human rights and make our government work better. (1/9) Yesterday, the House passed my amendment to curb the outrageous medical bills that civilians can face after trauma care at Brooke Army Medical Center.  Once signed into law, my amendment will ensure that San Antonians can get lifesaving care at BAMC without ruinous costs. (2/9) The treatment of migrants should be a key consideration when @StateDept evaluates human rights around the world.  Under my House-passed amendment, the State Department will be required to include this information in their annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. (3/9) The United States should not be selling weapons to human rights abusers.  The amendment that I secured with @RepMcGovern will strengthen reporting and oversight of overseas arms sales to stop U.S. weapons from falling into dangerous hands. (4/9) When Congress established @DFCGov to support U.S. development projects &amp; global leadership, we also set up @DFC_OIG to ensure DFC &amp; taxpayers were protected against waste, fraud, and abuse. My amendment gives the DFC OIG the authorities they need to do their important work. (5/9) Propaganda from our adversaries is a threat to democracy at home &amp; around the world.  I'm proud to have worked w/@RepCicilline on a House-passed amendment to extend the life of the @StateDept Global Engagement Center, which combats foreign propaganda &amp; influence campaigns. (6/9) I'm deeply concerned by reports about the use of U.S.-made weapons by the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.  Under my amendments with @RepTedLieu &amp; @RepSaraJacobs, the @StateDept and @DeptofDefense will review our security agreements to protect human rights &amp; civilian safety. (7/9) When our servicemembers and diplomats return from overseas, they should be able to bring their family pets home too.  I'm glad that the House passed my bipartisan amendments w/@RepDeanPhillips &amp; @RepBrianFitz to help public servants vaccinate their pets and fly them home.

I'm pleased to share some of the key progress that is on the table this year üëá (1/9) This year's defense budget gives servicemembers &amp; civilian defense employees a well-deserved raise and codifies a $15 minimum wage for contractors.  To help military families cope with inflation, it also authorizes a new bonus for servicemembers earning less than $45k. (2/9) Military families make many sacrifices for our country, but good housing and childcare shouldn't be among them.  In this year's defense budget, we voted to authorize nearly $80 million for dormitory and child development center improvements at Lackland and Randolph AFB. (3/9) As Congress works to bring housing and rental prices back down, the 2023 defense budget also increases the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) to keep housing affordable for military families. (4/9) As food prices rise, we need to make sure that commissaries remain affordable.  This year's defense budget adds $750 million in funding to keep commissary costs from rising and help military families put healthy food on the table. (5/9) The murder of Vanessa Guill√©n put a spotlight on the need for change in our military justice system.  The 2023 defense budget builds on last year's improvements to military justice and creates a victim compensation fund to support survivors of interpersonal crimes. (6/9) Our servicemembers and their families deserve top-notch health care that meets their needs.  As part of the 2023 defense budget, I was proud to vote to expand mental health care access, eliminate TRICARE copays for contraception, and increase access to infertility services (7/9). To support <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span> refugee resettlement, the 2023 defense budget will also extend SIV authorization and expand pathways to qualify for these visas.  San Antonio is home to thousands of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span> refugees. We would be glad to welcome more of the heroes who helped our troops. (8/9). The defense budget also includes amendments I authored to reduce the cost of civilian treatment at BAMC, strengthen operations at the @StateDept, @DFCgov, and other agencies, and keep U.S. weapons out of the hands of human rights abusers. Stay tuned to learn more. (9/9)</em>‚Äù</p>

The appraisal industry has acknowledged a history of bias that has led to big disparities in the assessments of home valuations for white families &amp; families of color.   A key to closing this gap is promoting diversity within the profession.   That's what my amendment will do. Some other items I was proud to support in the #FY23NDAA: -A 4.6% pay raise for service members and civilian personnel as well as a 2.4% inflation bonus for service members earning less than $45,000 per year; -Support for HBCUs and other minority serving institutions; -Support for our allies &amp; partners around the world, including $1 billion for Ukraine; -Extending the authorization of the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span> Special Immigrant Visas program; -Funding to support supply chain security; -Critical investments in science &amp; technology competitiveness; and more While no NDAA is perfect, the #FY23NDAA is a fair compromise that provides our troops &amp; their families with a pay raise &amp; additional benefits, funds defense programs critical to our national security, and gives America &amp; our allies the strength needed to face any future threat.</em>‚Äù</p>

This bill will only further militarize foreign policy, lining the pockets of defense contractors while inevitably costing the lives of innocent people around the world. Despite an amendment I introduced, it blocks humanitarian aid to the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span> people, further militarizes the Middle East and Indo-Pacific, and continues weapons sales to some of the most heinous human rights abusers in the world. Despite its flaws, I will not stop working to bring our foreign policy more in line with the values of the Fifth District and our country. That's why I'm pleased the final bill includes my amendment to help prevent civilian harm and human rights violations, by including them in annual reporting.  I was also proud that an amendment I co-led to require a report on the humanitarian impact of US sanctions was included.
