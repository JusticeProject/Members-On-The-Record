This builds on our work to #TREATLongCOVID &amp; collect better data on COVID so we can respond in real time.  We must support our #LongHaulers. Another amendment I'm proud to co-lead with @NydiaVelazquez prohibits the transfer of military weapons to local law enforcement agencies through DoD's 1033 program.  It would help end the militarization of police &amp; protect Black &amp; brown communities disproportionately brutalized. I've also co-sponsored an amendment led by @EleanorNorton to dismantle America's nuclear weapons &amp; another led by @RepAndreCarson to require a report on the death of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Palestinian</span>-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. These amendments would help address the overlapping pain felt in our communities, in our military families, and across the globe.  I'll keep fighting for legislation that is intersectional, upholds our values, and centers healing &amp; justice everywhere. Every bill that comes to the floor is an opportunity to press for a world where we prioritize our communities, our democracy &amp; our healing over state violence and militarization.   This is no exception.</em>‚Äù</p>
