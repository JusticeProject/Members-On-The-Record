Our U.S. military presence in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span> necessitates a long overdue vote in Congress. I was proud to introduce this <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span> amendment for the first time in last year's NDAA and to be joined by Congressional leaders on war powers. The majority of our caucus agrees on this common-sense amendment, in addition to several colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Former Ambassador to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span> Robert Ford has been raising these issues for years and I'm grateful for his advocacy. The American people  deserve transparency about how the Pentagon uses its funding -  which exceeds our spending on domestic priorities like education, health, and housing combined. We also need a public disclosure to identify our overseas military footprint. In addition, we need transparency about recruitment practices at our public schools, especially in underserved communities of color where opportunities may seem limited and unavailable. We need to take care of our lowest paid service members &amp; DOD civilian employees. There's no reason anyone, including our service members &amp; their families, should be relying on food pantry lines or wondering how they are going to afford basic &amp; necessary costs like child care. My priority is taking care of people, and making sure we are holding the Pentagon accountable when it comes to how we spend billions of dollars every year.
