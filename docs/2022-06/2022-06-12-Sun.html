This comes 3 days after I voted for the Protect Our Kids Act, which included my Safe Guns, Safe Kids bill to require gun owners to secure their weapons if there's a child in the home. <a href="https://twitter.com/ElissaSlotkin/status/1535989190705438720/photo/1">Link to image</a> It was particularly meaningful to have some members of the Oxford community there, representing as the Oxford march attracted more than 500 people. As someone who grew up in a gun-owning family and carried a Glock and an M4 during my 3 tours in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> alongside the military, I can tell you that it's a false choice to say you either believe in responsible gun ownership or believe in keeping our children safe. The good news is that I've heard from more hunters, sportsmen, and other responsible gun owners in the last two weeks than I have in the last 4 years. They know that keeping guns out of the hands of people with mental illness is critical. They can and should be allies in keeping our children safe, and we need their participation in this moment. Now all eyes turn to the Senate. As I told the crowd yesterday, I am ready to support any compromise — because moving the needle, even if it's not all one side wants, is still better then the paralysis we have today.</em>”</p>
