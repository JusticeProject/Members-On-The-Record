In addition, Biden has threatened American oil producers to increase production. üßµ1/9 With oil at historic highs of price per barrel, one would believe that American producers would already be producing every barrel possible to sell at the high price. 2/9 This is a total deflection by the Biden Admin, when it is their own failed policies that crippled the American energy (oil &amp; gas) sector by design! Biden, as a presidential candidate, told us he planned to kill the industry and now, Americans are paying the price. 3/9 The Dept. of @ENERGY was est. in 1977 to lessen/end our dependence on foreign sources of energy &amp; they have failed. But let me remind America that, during the Trump Admin, America became a net exporter of oil, not to mention our huge export opportunity for natural gas! 4/9 Americans remember this, and due to the amazing production of American oil and gas resources prior to January 20, 2021, prices at the pump were around $2.00/gallon. 5/9 Yes, global events (Ukraine and uncertainty in Asia) have affected the oil and gas markets. Remember that Russia and their proxy Venezuela participate in OPEC. Futures markets trade on this uncertainty and oil reflects this uncertainty. 6/9 Let me be clear: taking American production off-line, killing the Keystone XL pipeline that would provide the oil from Canada (which American refineries need to produce the petroleum products &amp; increase supply) &amp; canceling leases have directly affected supply &amp; the markets. 7/9 Instead of bowing down to the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span>s, Biden can simply stay home, save gasoline &amp; reduce carbon emissions, &amp; flip the switch on American energy production. It's pretty simple ‚Äì we witnessed the results directly during the American Energy Renaissance under President Trump. 8/9 And how hypocritical is it for the Biden Admin. to kill American energy (oil &amp; gas production) under the guise of ‚Äúclimate change,‚Äù but beg oil &amp; gas producing countries to increase production because of the political realities that nationwide gas prices are bringing to bear? 9/9</em>‚Äù</p>
