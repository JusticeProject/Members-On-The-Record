The United States should instead be ramping up domestic energy production and becoming energy independent again. US energy policy has been so backwards since President Biden got into office. Right out of the gate, he shut down the Keystone XL pipeline project and fast tracked NordStream2. In New York, the state should reverse its ban on the safe extraction of natural gas and approve new pipeline construction applications.
