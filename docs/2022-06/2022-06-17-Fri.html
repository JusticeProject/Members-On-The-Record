After meeting with a group of Ukrainian legislators this week, here are some basics. 1/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1537541099761418240/photo/1">Link to image</a> Putin is using his leverage over energy &amp; food to try to wait the world out. He is counting on the international community to buckle because the Ukrainians can't get grain out of their Black Sea ports and because of high energy costs. 2/14 Russia is blocking commercial shipping through the Black Sea ‚Äî which means the rest of the world pays the price. Putin knows the cost of food will continue to rise, and that in countries like <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Egypt</span> down to South Africa, there could be real instability as shortages hit. 3/14 On oil and gas, Putin is counting on our European allies to waver when it comes to restrictions on Russian imports as the weather turns cold in the fall, and that high energy prices worldwide will create political pressure. 4/14 For both these reasons, it is to Russia's advantage to wait us out, secure the narrow military victories they can, and only come to the negotiating table if they have the clear advantage. 5/14 The Ukrainians can only stomach coming to the table if *they* have military victories under their belt. And right now, the outlook isn't ideal. After their remarkable showing at the start of the war, they need expedited materiel now ‚Äî including longer range weapons. 6/14 I understand the admin's concerns that providing long-range weapons risks escalation, but the Ukrainians have &amp; should continue to commit to using them only in defending their territory ‚Äî not targeting Russia. But they need to be able to compete against Russian advantages. 7/14 So what can we do? It's clear we need to speed up our support. Whether it's hastening the shipments of promised weapons or identifying longer-range systems, we have a very limited window ‚Äî essentially this summer ‚Äî to help the Ukrainians compete and advance. 8/14 On the question of Ukrainian grain, I hope that serious conversations are happening in the Situation Room and within the international community on what specifically we can do to get that grain out of Ukrainian ports. 9/14 Negotiations are ideal, but we need to get creative &amp; specific about which country (or countries) could provide security for ships carrying grain. Putin has effectively internationalized his war, making millions of people around the world the victims of Russia's aggression. 10/14 All options should be on the table to respond ‚Äî including a humanitarian escort involving NATO or other Black Sea countries ‚Äî to protect commercial shipping so we can get that grain moving. 11/14 But here's the rub: if the Ukrainians lose ground over the summer, they are unlikely to go to the negotiating table ‚Äî it becomes a frozen conflict that's terrible for them and terrible for the international community. 12/14 And if the grain doesn't get out, the U.S. &amp; others will be paying for Russian aggression ‚Äî not just in our own skyrocketing food &amp; gas prices, but also to manage the fallout in conflicts around the globe in starving or destabilized countries. 13/14 It may seem like the conflict in Ukraine is fading into the background, but this is fundamental. Whether you're a staunch believer in preserving democracy or just want to protect the pocketbooks of the American people, ramping up in the near term needs to be a top priority. 14/14</em>‚Äù</p>

With the Senate approving a landmark bill to address toxic exposure for our veterans, today was one of those days. 1/8 <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1537502766611963906/photo/1">Link to image</a> A little while ago, the Senate took a major step towards finally addressing toxic exposure by passing the Honoring our PACT Act, a bipartisan package to finally make sure our veterans who have been exposed to burn pits &amp; other toxins get the treatment &amp; support they deserve. 2/8 As the roll was called, I was lucky enough to watch from the Senate gallery with Ryan Hart and his family, who are visiting DC from Springfield Township for the induction ceremony of his late father, Paul, to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Honor Roll. 3/8 <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1537502774677618688/photo/1">Link to image</a> Paul Hart passed away two years ago from lung cancer that resulted from exposure to Agent Orange during his service. It took our government decades to finally acknowledge the damage Agent Orange did to our troops, and too many lives were lost as a result. 4/8 Now, the 9/11 generation of American veterans - including many Michiganders - are struggling with the long-term consequences of burn pits, and red tape at the VA is blocking them from getting the care they're entitled to. 5/8 The Veterans Burn Pits Exposure Recognition Act, my bill with @RepMeijer, is part of the package. It cuts red tape to make it easier for veterans to get benefits &amp; care. I'm thrilled it's included in this package, which the House will soon send to the President's desk. 6/8 This bill is a watershed moment for our veterans, and as someone who lived near burn pits in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span>, it's personal to me &amp; has been one of my top priorities in Congress.¬†I've met too many Michigan veterans who have had to jump through legal hoops just to prove their exposure. 7/8 As we get ready to give the bill a final push over the finish line, it was an honor to share this moment with Ryan and his family ‚Äî an important reminder that we can still get big things done to help people, especially our men and women in uniform. 8/8 <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1537502788699176962/photo/1">Link to image</a></em>‚Äù</p>
