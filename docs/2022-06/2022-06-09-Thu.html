I received widespread support from the Democratic caucus‚Ä¶ üßµ including CBC Chairwoman Beatty, CHC Chairman Ruiz, CAPAC Chairwoman Chu, Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus Chairman Cicilline, CPC Chair Jayapal, Rep. Higgins, Rep. Takano, and Rep. Raskin who co-led the resolution along with a diverse coalition of members of‚Ä¶ Congress who co-sponsored the resolution. The ‚ÄúGreat Replacement Theory‚Äù has been the root cause of a string of hateful mass murders and terrorist acts around the world from Buffalo, NY to Christchurch, New Zealand. This resolution is an exercise of Congress' duty to acknowledge and condemn acts of racial violence and the beliefs that are used to falsely justify them, as well as reaffirm the federal government's responsibility to combat white supremacy in all‚Ä¶ forms, with a coordinated whole-of-government approach. Gun violence is an existential threat to us all, but it takes deep hate and brainwashing to kill people simply for their race, religion or national origin. We must tackle both gun reform and fight against hate of all kind to truly eradicate these shocking and shattering mass killings. Congress cannot sit by idly and pretend not to see the impact of the Great Replacement Theory in fueling these acts of terrorism. Today, I am proud to stand here and lead the introduction of this resolution that condemns the Great Replacement Theory as a white supremacist conspiracy theory that seeks to murder minorities, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Jews</span>, Muslims and immigrants alike. I am proud to be joined by my distinguished colleagues and fellow Democrats in taking a first step towards a future that is led by love and truth, not hate and lies. Thank you to all our co-leads @RepJayapal @RepRaulRuizMD @RepJudyChu @RepRaskin @RepMarkTakano @RepBeatty @RepCicilline and @RepBrianHiggins</em>‚Äù</p>
