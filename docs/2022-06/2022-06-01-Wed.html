Trudeau quickly filled his father's shoes, but in Canada not Cuba.  This video emits nauseating weakness.

Trudeau foolishly completely ignores how taking guns away from his people makes his country weak and vulnerable to being invaded and easily taken over by another stronger country.  Like, perhaps Russia, who is very angry at America right now. 3. Canada has an incredibly weak military &amp; now with Trudeau's gun grab, his people are left defenseless not only by a criminal attacker, but also defenseless against another country's military invasion.  This is a terrible violation of rights to innocent Canadians by their Gov. 4. A heavily armed population backing up a strong military force is a mighty deterrent to any foreign would be invader.  Democrats know this too and they demanded Ukraine's people be armed with the same guns that cause them to shriek in outrage and they're rushing to ban here. 5. Does Trudeau expect America to defend them?  Of course, and so do the rest of western allied nations.   The US taxpayers pay for the defense of many countries that do not deserve our military support for free or at all. 6. Meanwhile the 3rd term Obama admin steps aside and turns their head to countries like <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span> &amp; North Korea working diligently to build their own nuclear arsenals.
