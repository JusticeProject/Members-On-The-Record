(THREAD) Since April, I have been working with the Biden Administration to get financial assistance to food insecure countries in Africa following Russia's illegal war in Ukraine that is fueling the global food crisis. The impact of this crisis has been felt most acutely in the Horn of Africa, which is facing unprecedented droughts and significant conflict and political instability. The United Nations has warned about the imminent ‚Äòexplosion of child deaths' due to food insecurity and malnutrition in the Horn of Africa. I am glad to see the United States and other countries step up to provide food insecure countries in Africa, including <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Somalia</span> with the financial support to fight against famine and boost economic recovery efforts. These commitments are welcome, but much more is needed. With millions of people on the verge of famine, we need to continue to rally all world leaders to increase supplies of food and fertilizers, support basic safety nets for those without food, and fund humanitarian operations to reduce famine and hunger. As the Vice Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, I will continue to fight to end the global food crisis and work towards a more prosperous continent.
