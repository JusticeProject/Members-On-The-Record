This goes for the shooter in Oxford, as well as the thousands of instances where kids have stolen guns for crime or have accidentally harmed or killed others with a family member's gun. 4/8 Ensuring that firearms are properly stored, and not left to fall into the hands of those who could use them for violence or crime, is essential. 5/8 I come from a gun-owning family, and I carried a Glock and an M4 on my three tours in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> with the CIA. There are millions of responsible gun owners in Michigan, including people I love, like my dad. 6/8 But we just need to do more: no American community should have to go through what Oxford is going through. The parents of the killer there played a devastating role in the lives of these four young Michiganders and thousands more in our community. 7/8 Responsibility is at the heart of what it means to be American, and they need to be held to account. 8/8</em>‚Äù</p>

Her answer was not very reassuring to the families whose loved ones are trapped behind enemy lines under Afghan Taliban terrorists' control because of the incompetence of the Biden Administration. Expressing concern about Americans and our Afghan allies living in fear of the Afghan Taliban is not the same as tracking Americans abroad ‚Äì helping those we left behind is the only action that a nation who believes in honor can take. If we abandon those who fought bravely along our side against radical Islam, who will help us in the future?   What a sad state of affairs. This is the best evidence yet that the Biden Administration is trying to wash their hands of the debacle they created in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. It will not work because Americans and honorable people around the world will continue to call on the Administration to fulfill its commitment to help those who helped us in difficult times.</em>‚Äù</p>
