Its unilateral withdraw from #<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> destroyed trust among our #NATO allies and eroded U.S. credibility around the world. It will take decades to repair.

This would hurt, not help, NATO &amp; other allies. While I agree with the policy behind #AUKUS, it's ham-handed rollout fed #France's distrust of the Biden Administration. We need to rebuild trust between the U.S. and France, not further damage it. On trade, the Biden Admin is sacrificing our Canadian ally in favor of climate politics. The ‚ÄúBuy America" EV rebate plan will ultimately destroy the Canadian auto sector and violates the U.S.-#Canada-#Mexico Agreement. Our friends deserve better. Finally, I'm not surprised @presssec made no mention of #Ukraine. The White House has sat on a security assistance package for Ukraine for weeks. What are they waiting for?
