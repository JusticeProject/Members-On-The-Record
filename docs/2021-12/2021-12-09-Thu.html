THREAD: We've never faced a threat like China. They're far larger than us or Soviets ever were, &amp; their theft of our tech has let them surpass us in key technologies like hypersonic missiles &amp; AI, among others.  They're constantly expanding &amp; improving the reach of their <span class="MOTR_Keyword">military</span>. (2/8) Because this is a new challenge, we need new investments to meet it.  PA institutions like @NETL_DOE &amp; @CarnegieMellon need new funding to invent, research &amp; develop solutions to difficult problems in energy &amp; cybersecurity, among others. (3/8) The <span class="MOTR_Keyword">military</span> needs new tech platforms, new <span class="MOTR_Keyword">drone</span>s &amp; ships &amp; cyber capabilities.   And because people win wars, we need to fund new training &amp; retention programs to make sure we have the best &amp; the brightest, &amp; not everyone gets hired away to Silicon Valley. (4/8) For a sense of scale, we hope to soon pass the US Innovation &amp; Competition Act, a $110B investment in the most important tech.  The program is designed to target places like Pittsburgh &amp; Philadelphia, more so than Silicon Valley. (5/8) Add that to our latest defense bill, which costs $200B above what we spent in 2015.  These increases in spending quickly get to $500B, &amp; the experts I've talked to consider this a bare minimum. (6/8) Now @RonWyden's Billionaire Tax comes in. Roughly 700 households would pay it, &amp; many of them gained wealth during the pandemic by watching the market go up.  Would generate ~$500B, close to the bare minimum we need for better tech &amp; a more capable <span class="MOTR_Keyword">military</span> than China. (7/8) Experts say that we're approaching a crossroads. China bets we take the path of inequality, division &amp; weakness.  If instead we match the strength of our most fortunate with the ingenuity of our scientists &amp; soldiers, we win.   We've done if before &amp; we can do it again.
