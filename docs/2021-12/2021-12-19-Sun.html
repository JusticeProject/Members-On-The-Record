It particularly hurts to see this hate in the town where I grew up.2/10 Just a few weeks ago a swastika was found in the parking lot of a synagogue nearby. A sixth grader was the one who discovered it.  That breaks my hearts to know that a child came across that threat. 3/10 <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/andykimnj/status/1467578042004422660">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">A sixth grader just found this disgusting hate at a synagogue in my community. We must all stand united against threats to Adath Emanu-el and all communities. As we reach the end of Hanukkah, I ask that you join me to show that love and unity are everywhere, not hate. (Link to twitter.com)</span></a> But we as adults must work harder not only to ensure that our kids are not exposed to hate, but that they do not tolerate or even further it. As far as I know we don't know who drew the swastikas but we confront the possibility that it was a child that did it. 4/10 The school has made clear ‚ÄúIn addition to punitive consequences, any involved students will receive lessons‚Ä¶in understanding the gravity and hurtfulness of their actions, along with participation in restorative practices intentionally designed to deepen this understanding.‚Äù5/10 This deeper understanding is needed, but not just for the students that may have been involved, but for everyone. We cannot fight hate if we are only reactionary. Instead of Whack-a-mole actions after the fact, we need to confront how we teach and internalize tolerance. 6/10 Our county prosecutor Scott Coffina had some powerful reflections on the need to promote decency as a society. I agree wholeheartedly that it feels like we are losing touch with how to just treat each other with respect and decency.7/10 <a href="https://burlpros.org/statement-from-prosecutor-coffina-concerning-the-discovery-of-swastikas-and-related-hate-speech-in-marlton-middle-school/">Statement from Prosecutor Coffina concerning the discovery of swastikas and related hate speech in Marlton Middle School... | burlpros.org</a> Yes the schools play a role, but it's important for parents to have these tough conversations with our kids. I've struggled to find the right words to talk to my little boys. I often give excuses that they are ‚Äútoo little to understand‚Äù or maybe when they get ‚Äúa little older‚Äù8/10 But I make a New Year's resolution to do better and commit to having a talk with my boys. Though it's not just how we talk to our kids but also what kind of example we set for them. That is where we as a county are clearly letting down our children.9/10 We have become a nation addicted to anger. Violence is not only normalized/expected, but even regular interactions on the street or work have become venues for confrontation. No doubt we have disagreements in our society, but let's not lose sight of the decency between us. END</em>‚Äù</p>
