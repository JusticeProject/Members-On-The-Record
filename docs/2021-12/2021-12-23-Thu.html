Festivus of course is highlighted by the airing of grievances. I've definitely got a lot of problems with you people. And by you people, I mostly mean the petty tyrants who run your local, state and federal governments. 2021 was a banner year for being a petty tyrant, with them all literally tripping over each other for the dumbest covid lockdown or mandate idea. Washington DC never likes to take a back seat to any petty tyrant. So of course their regulations were almost as bad and their mayor almost as big a hypocrite <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dc-mayor-bowser-mask-list-covid-hypocrites">DC Mayor Bowser rejoins ever-growing list of COVID hypocrites... | foxnews.com</a> Honestly, I'm torn on whether it's worse that these tyrants flouted their own rules or if it's worse if they thought they mattered. ‚Äúhey you, wear some cotton underwear on your face from the host table to your dinner table.‚ÄùThat'll fix everything. It was never clear to me if they thought Covid gathered at entrances, or if they thought it only traveled 5 feet and above, so once you sat down you were all clear.

But instead of losing a game, he's cost a lot of lives and fortunes this past 18 months. of course Fauci didn't limit himself to Covid this year. He also funded torturing puppies and monkeys.
