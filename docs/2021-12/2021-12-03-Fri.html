I cannot in good conscience vote for funding that could go to forcing injections on American citizens. 3) Funding in this CR could be used to support Biden's dangerous open boarder immigration policies, pay for his efforts to fund abortions, support school policies that push Critical Race Theory, or subvert parents' educational rights. I cannot support these things. 4) The CR includes $7 billion for <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span> evacuees brought to America. It's confirmed that 82,000 <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span>s received no vetting at all--Biden administration lied. We cannot pour more taxpayer dollars into this possibly dangerous situation until the American people have transparency. My colleagues on the Left will say that GOP opposition to this CR threatens to shut down government. But they have willfully created a bill fully of unacceptable moral, legal, and budgetary problems. I will be happy to vote for a funding bill that is offered in good faith.</em>‚Äù</p>
