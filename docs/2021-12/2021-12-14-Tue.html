As we spoke, I had to remind myself of his evil actions because he came off quite charming. But that's what evil is—deception. /2 One observation I took away from my night with Saddam Hussein was that he was a megalomaniac to the highest degree. I asked him why he invaded Kuwait. He told me that all of humankind comes from the Tigris and Euphrates River. /3 What he meant was: Everyone is an <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span>i, and I'm the president of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span>. He was implying, “I can do anything I want, I am the president of the world.” /4 As I reflect on this day, I will never forget the Special Operators I served alongside or the justice that prevailed. /5</em>”</p>
