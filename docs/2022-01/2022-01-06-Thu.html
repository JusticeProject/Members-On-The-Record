The Vice President and the Senate entered the House for the Joint Session to begin. As the results for Alabama and Alaska were certified and accepted, I braced to see what would happen when Arizona was called. Paul Gosar rose to object. His objection was seconded by Ted Cruz and many on the Republican side cheered. I felt something very dark was beginning. During the debate, I began receiving alarmed texts from friends, family and staff asking where I was. I responded that I was on the House floor, which to me meant that I was in one of the safest places in the world. An announcement was made that the Capitol was under attack, but that we were safe and should continue the proceedings. Soon thereafter, security personnel swept into the Chamber and grabbed our top leadership and hurried them out. We again tried to continue the debate, now with @RepMcGovern presiding. But soon thereafter, the proceedings were again interrupted and we were told that the mob had breached the Capitol, that tear gas had been deployed in the rotunda, and to grab the gas masks under our seats. I took off my suit jacket and prepared to fight. Several of my colleagues joined me in taking off their jackets. You can see me helping @RepJeffries with his mask here. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepColinAllred/status/1479134126364053515/photo/1">Link to image</a> I texted my pregnant wife at home with our two year-old, ‚ÄúWhatever happens, I love you.‚Äù The ornamental doors were closed and locked.

In my mind, I was preparing to make a last stand. <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2021/01/06/whatever-happens-i-love-you-dallas-rep-colin-allred-recalls-chaotic-scene-as-mob-breached-the-capitol/">‚ÄòWhatever happens, I love you': Dallas Rep. Colin Allred recalls chaotic scene as mob breached the Capitol... | dallasnews.com</a> We could hear banging on the doors that the President walks through to give the State of the Union. The doors were barricaded with furniture usually used to hold legislative papers. The officers in the chamber pulled their guns and told us to stay away from the doors. Eventually the call came to evacuate. As I left I turned &amp; saw glass flying from the main door as rioters tried to break in. The officers stayed behind, guns drawn &amp; pointed. They saved my life. I would not have met my son Cameron if not for their bravery. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/RepColinAllred/status/1346916705130459140?s=20">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">I was evacuated from the House floor and am currently¬†safe.</span></a> As we evacuated, I saw the Parliamentarians carrying some of the priceless heirlooms from the Speaker's rostrum, the oldest things the House still has dating back to our earliest days. I asked why, and he said to make sure they weren't lost to history. In the secured room I still did not feel we were safe, so I took apart a stanchion and prepared to use it to defend the room if it too came under attack. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepColinAllred/status/1479134140226318340/photo/1">Link to image</a> I did multiple interviews from that room, including the @dallasnews article above. The rioters were still in the Capitol, but I was determined to go back to the floor as soon as possible to certify the election. You can see me here with @RepPeteAguilar and @RepJeffries. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepColinAllred/status/1479134144714186752/photo/1">Link to image</a> Nearly everyone in that room, Republicans and Democrats alike, were shocked. I saw the looks on some of my colleagues' faces who now say the 6th wasn't dangerous, wasn't an insurrection. They are not telling the truth. I was with them, I saw and heard their shock and horror too. But in that moment, I felt a strong determination to not let the insurrectionists win and to not let them stop our democratic process and erase the will of the American people. And we did so that night. A strong bipartisan vote certifying the results. We all must come together: Democrats, Republicans, Independents &amp; recommit to the fight of the civil rights giants who came before, including my friend John Lewis, working harder than ever to protect the right to vote. Our democracy &amp; country depend on it. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/05/opinions/january-6-anniversary-voting-rights-allred/index.html">Opinion: What I witnessed on January 6... | cnn.com</a></em>‚Äù</p>
