Let us recognize and highlight the alarming rise in antisemitism and antisemitic violence across the United States. According to @AJCGlobal's ‚ÄúState of Antisemitism in America Report,‚Äù almost 4 in 10 American Jews changed their behavior in 2021 out of fear of antisemitism. Jews across the country have been feeling the palpable fear and trauma that stems from the Tree of Life and Poway synagogue mass shootings and many smaller incidents. During the January 6 insurrection, a rioter was pictured wearing a ‚ÄúCamp Auschwitz‚Äù sweatshirt. A school board in Tennessee voted this month to ban the Holocaust book ‚ÄúMAUS‚Äù from their curricula. Less than two weeks ago, Jewish worshippers and a rabbi were held hostage at Congregation Beth <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> in Colleyville, Texas during Shabbat services. We must loudly and consistently call out antisemitism in all its forms. On this International #HolocaustRemembranceDay, let us celebrate the unity and resilience of our communities, as we come together to combat the interwoven forms of hatred that threaten us and build a safer, more compassionate world for all.</em>‚Äù</p>
