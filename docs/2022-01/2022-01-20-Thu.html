Why do you refuse to acknowledge the border crisis? Americans lost 7% of their income to inflation last year after your $2 Trillion American Rescue Plan, that we knew would fuel inflation, was passed.   Why do you continue to pursue inflationary spending policies? Why have you not fired @SecCardonas after he solicited the letter from the School Boards Association comparing concerned parents to domestic terrorists? Why did your @FBI find it necessary to claim this weekend's terrorist hostage attack on a Texas synagogue was not motivated by anti<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span>? $6 Trillion in American taxpayer dollars has been spent on so-called “covid-relief,” and hundreds of billions have been lost to fraud, waste, and misuse.   How can your admin justify asking for even more money for COVID? Your chaotic Afghanistan evacuation led to the abandonment of tens of thousands of Afghan allies and hundreds of American citizens.   We haven't forgotten. When will they be rescued? Why did you cancel the Keystone XL pipeline, that would have provided 10k+ jobs to Americans, and then turn around and lobby for Russia's Nord Stream II pipeline?   You should be putting #MidlandOverMoscow Considering your recent comments, do you really think those who support voter ID laws are George Wallace?

It's safe to say this is the worst first year of a presidency in modern history.  We've seen our energy industry attacked, our medical freedom infringed upon, and our standing on the world stage diminished.  THREAD Biden began his administration with an assault on the American energy industry by shutting down pipelines and banning drilling on federal lands and waters, threatening millions of jobs nationwide and hundreds of thousands in my home state of Texas. Biden created the worst border crisis in decades when he rolled back Trump's border security policies. More than 1.7 MILLION illegal immigrants crossed our border during his FIRST YEAR.   November saw the highest number of crossings ever for that month, a 300% spike from 2019. Inflation surged to 6.8% in 2021, an invisible tax on Americans that's forcing people to pay more for everyday goods.  Meanwhile, Biden's first year in office erased 3 years of real wage growth for American families. Instead of addressing rising crime across the country, Joe Biden's FBI decided to target parents who are rightly concerned about what their kids are learning in school. Biden is directly responsible for the disastrous withdrawal in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> that led to the deaths of 13 Americans and countless allies.   Biden's feckless foreign policy has emboldened authoritarians like Putin and Xi Jinping. In an assault on basic medical freedom and personal choice, Biden imposed an unconstitutional vaccine mandate on businesses and healthcare workers, forcing people to choose between their jobs or the vaccine. Biden pushed the most damaging legislation in American history that would have killed American energy jobs, raised taxes on middle-class families, and made an already historic inflation crisis worse.  Thankfully that bill is dead. It should never be revived. This is what one-year of a Biden Administration got us. None of it is good for our country.  Yesterday Biden said the report card of his first year in office is “pretty good.” That's laughably out of touch.  Joe Biden gets an F, for failure, on every single issue he's touched.</em>”</p>

Never in the history of this nation has a President done so much harm in so little time. Americans know all too well that under Joe Biden, it has been a year of unprecedented CRISES:  ❌ Job crisis ❌ Inflation crisis ❌ Energy crisis ❌ National security crisis ❌ Crime crisis ❌ Border crisis Joe Biden and House Democrats paid people not to work.  Now, businesses are struggling to fill over 10.5 million job openings – a near record high – yet there are more than 6.3 MILLION unemployed Americans. Thanks to Joe Biden and House Democrats' reckless policies, inflation is at a record high–the highest ever in my lifetime!  #Bidenflation is a TAX on every American, as we pay more for food, gas, and just about everything in between. Joe Biden has increased our dependence on foreign oil and caused an energy CRISIS.   Every day, Americans are paying more and more to heat their homes and fill up their cars. Joe Biden's disastrous withdrawal from <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> cost American lives and left our allies and weapons in the hands of terrorists.  After just one year in office, Joe Biden's legacy already includes creating the largest national security failure in a generation. In the last year, Democrats worked tirelessly to defund our police department.   It's no surprise that crime has SKYROCKETED across American cities. And while Americans are forced to face authoritarian and unconstitutional mandates that stop them from entering local restaurants, illegal immigrants POUR across the southern border in record numbers. The only bright light at the end of the tunnel is ELECTION DAY on November 8th, when Republicans take back the House to STOP the reckless Biden-Pelosi agenda.
