Perhaps the question is not so much why did this one attacker chose a synagogue but why, irrespective of grievance, attacks disproportionately target synagogues and Jews? Why do synagogues across the US, and around the world, require extra security, every single day?  Why are Jews warned when traveling to hide any public displays of their faith? Why do so many question the legitimacy of a <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Jewish state</span> in the birthplace of the Jewish faith and the homeland of the Jewish people? The answers to all these questions are rooted in the simple reality of antisemitism. The American white nationalist who murdered 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life Synagogue and the British national who held 4 worshipers captive at Congregation Beth Israel shared nothing in common‚Äînothing but their choice to attack and terrorize Jews. Two things Congress can do immediately: (1) help Jewish institutions afford security enhancements, and (2) move forward on the appointment of Deborah Lipstadt as US Envoy to Combat and Monitor Antisemitism.</em>‚Äù</p>
