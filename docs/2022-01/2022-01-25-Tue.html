When you're dealing with somebody like #Putin, or others who respect nothing except power, you need to demonstrate your willingness to take action. That will do more for deterrence than a thousand speeches. Under the prior administration, #Putin knew that he was dealing with people who were tough enough to do what needed to be done. With the Biden Administration, he's found weakness and he will exploit it. Every single member of Congress, 535 people, wanted #NordStream2 stopped. We passed law after law, but the Biden Admin just simply won't do it. If I were #Putin, I'd have a hard time believing these sanctions will actually be put on. Considering the way #Russia has built up troops on #Ukraine's border, there's plenty of reason right now to take action &amp; enact sanctions. We cannot wait until after the fact ‚Äì at that point, it's too late. Middle East problems are all about #Iran. The #JCPOA was a weak instrument that put the Iranians on the road to possess a nuclear weapon when we want to stop it. The Biden Admin doesn't have the strength to do what needs to be done ‚Äì we'll have to leave that to #<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>. It's official U.S. policy that the tensions between #China and #Taiwan need to be resolved peacefully. How that happens and when that happens are unknown, but the U.S. cannot stand on the sidelines in the face of #CCP intimidation &amp; aggression.</em>‚Äù</p>
