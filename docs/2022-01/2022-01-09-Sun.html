He wasn't. - Mistook Michigan's COVID numbers for military toll.  - Claimed that Trump could've prevented every last COVID death if he had "done his job".  - Said there were no courts in session between Sep 20, 2020 &amp; election day, when in fact there were seven scheduled before elections. - Claimed the Trump campaign asked for a list of potential SCOTUS nominees after RBG's passing, when they requested it nine days prior.  - Inflated the number of clemency actions from Obama by 16,073.  - Falsely claimed funding for community policing was eliminated. - Said he could send every qualified person to a four-year college in their state for $150B."   - Incorrectly claimed if minimum wage was indexed to inflation it would be $20/hr  - Called Kamala Harris a qualified person. We know how that one turned out. - Claimed no VA Governor has been elected when they're of the same party as the sitting president when Terry McAuliffe was elected during Obama's presidency.  - Repeatedly brought up being a tractor-trailer driver when no evidence supports this. - Said the confirmation of Judge Amy Coney Barrett during an election year is "not constitutional," when it said no such thing.  - Says the boilermaker union endorsed him ‚Äî they didn't.  - Claimed to be sending back the majority of families crossing the border illegally. - Said he could send every qualified person to a four-year college in their state for $150B."   - Incorrectly claimed if minimum wage was indexed to inflation it would be $20/hr  - Called Kamala Harris a qualified person.
