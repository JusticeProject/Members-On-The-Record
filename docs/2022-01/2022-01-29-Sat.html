After yet another recent terrorist attack on a Jewish community in Texas, it is critical for federal leaders to step up and defend the safety of our fellow Americans. <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-op-com-demings-antisemitism-security-funding-20220128-wzrhmvw2zvaetjzqcv5hudhbma-story.html">Leaders must step up to confront anti<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span> | Opinion</a> Rabbi Charlie Cytron-Walker from Colleyville, Texas said that ‚Äúit was years of security training‚Äù that helped them escape the hostage situation last week. I have been a champion for this funding, and we should expand it. As a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, my #1 priority in Congress has been to strengthen federal security programs that have kept Floridians safe. This work has made Florida's non-profits, faith-based organizations, and houses of worship eligible for a separate set of critical security grants. Last year we doubled this funding and provided $6.5 million for organizations in South Florida and millions more across the state. These grants are critically important. In 2019 a sixty-eight-year-old man named Yosef Lifshutz was shot six times in the leg in a hate crime. Just this week, antisemitic fliers were left outside of hundreds of homes in Miami Beach. In the wake of the terrorist hostage-taking in Texas earlier this month, it is critical that we fully support the critical federal programs that provide security training and services to Jewish institutions across Florida. I know that America can do better because I have seen America do better. We can reject anti<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span> and hate. We can give Jewish organizations, and all Americans, the security and safety that they need to be free from fear and from violence.</em>‚Äù</p>
