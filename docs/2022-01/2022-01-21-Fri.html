Our border agents and communities are overwhelmed and @POTUS has just buried his head in the sand. 5‚É£ The <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> withdrawal was an abject failure and @POTUS bears the responsibility.

Period. 6‚É£ Our voting system is working, but @JoeBiden wasted his first year complaining about "voting rights," a fake crisis far removed from reality.   The Constitution entrusts states to run their elections. I trust North Dakota much more than DC bureaucrats. 7‚É£ Where do we begin on the sorry state of our economy? Biden's policies have led to inflation and supply chain crises, which have been utterly devastating.   In North Dakota, inflation has soared 7.5% in a year. The American people deserve better. 8‚É£ @POTUS' decisions to kneecap American energy have real effects.   He canceled Keystone XL, illegally halted lease sales, and pushed heavy-handed regulations then asked OPEC to bail him out. End result: we import more oil from Russia than we produce in Alaska. 9‚É£ The COVID-19 pandemic rages on and we've seen nothing but total mismanagement and the infringement of personal liberties from the Biden Administration.</em>‚Äù</p>

During his campaign, the President made numerous grandiose promises to the American people.  After 365 days in office, let's see how it's going:   üßµ Biden promised to unify our country &amp; said we ‚Äúhave to stop treating our opponents as enemies‚Äù. Now, the country is as divided as ever, and the President continues to stoke that flame with repeated attacks on the Americans who disagree with his agenda.    <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/joebiden/status/1324112939310264322">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">To make progress, we have to stop treating our opponents as enemies. We are not enemies.</span></a> Biden promised to ‚Äúshut down the virus, not the country‚Äù.  A year later, more Americans have died of COVID-19 during his presidency than under the previous Administration, and our economy remains stagnant under Biden's punitive economic policies.    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joebiden/posts/im-going-to-shut-down-the-virus-not-the-country/10157601140941104/">Log into Facebook | facebook.com</a> Biden said he would not mandate vaccination against COVID-19.  8 months later, he reversed course. If it weren't for the Supreme Court, all businesses with 100+ employees would be forced to comply. His mandate on the healthcare sector remains in place. Biden promised to advocate for the American worker, but his policies are harming working class Americans the most. Due to #Bidenflation, real wages have shrunk by at least 3%, and American families are paying an average of $3,500 more on basic goods.   <a href="https://joebiden.com/empowerworkers/">The Biden Plan for Strengthening Worker Organizing, Collective Bargaining, and Unions - Joe Biden for President: Official Campaign Website</a> Biden promised to remove all Americans from <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>.
