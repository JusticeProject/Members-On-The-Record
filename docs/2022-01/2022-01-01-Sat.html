                            <p><a href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1476997648989184000">Slotkin (D-MI-8)</a> 12/31/2021: Twitter thread &#8211; “<em>As we close out 2021, I'd be remiss not to acknowledge how hard this year has been. An insurrection. Impeachment. The heartbreaking scenes out of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. And, just this month, the gut-wrenching tragedy at Oxford High School. But in all the chaos, there have also been moments of joy that remind me of what we do here. So, I thought I'd share some of my moments of joy with you, and encourage you to reflect on yours, as well. My highlights included: throwing out the first pitch at a @LansingLugnuts game &amp; cheering on @MSU_Football to victory against U of M (&amp; beating @RepDebDingell in a prank war). Shortly after, I visited MSU's head coach, @Coach_mtucker and the Paul Bunyan trophy. <a href="https://twitter.com/ElissaSlotkin/status/1476997676143157254/photo/1">Link to image</a> Visiting Camp Grayling during the Northern Strike exercise &amp; witnessing the professionalism of our uniformed military up close &amp; personal. Working with my team to craft and pass meaningful, bipartisan legislation — like PAWS, a bill to connect veterans with service dogs. <a href="https://twitter.com/ElissaSlotkin/status/1476997690823221255/photo/1">Link to image</a> And, I was fortunate enough to travel to Albania to meet the Afghan nationals we worked day and night to evacuate out of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> in August — it was truly an experience I'll never forget. <a href="https://twitter.com/ElissaSlotkin/status/1476997701363453954/photo/1">Link to image</a> When things seem dark, making time for joy for you &amp; your loved ones is so important. I hope you take time to reflect on the moments of joy you've had in 2021 &amp; maybe plan some for 2022.   What was your best moment in 2021? Share it! It helps us all appreciate what's important.</em>”</p>
