A thread: The president is speaking in Georgia today to decry the state's election laws. What do GA's laws do? Makes ballot drop boxes permanent, expands early voting and offers free state ID's. It allows anyone to donate water and food to be handed out by poll workers to voters in line. Georgia now has more early voting days than Delaware, @POTUS's home state. What “voting rights” provisions are Democrats trying to pass?  ❌ Taking away states' ability to run their own elections ❌ Allowing unlimited ballot harvesting ❌ Funneling taxpayer dollars to campaigns ❌ Prohibiting commonsense voter ID laws ❌ Prohibiting states from cleaning up their voter rolls ❌ Allowing felons to vote ❌ Allowing non-citizens to vote ❌ Putting Democrats in charge of the FEC, a neutral organization that enforces election laws There is a reason Washington Democrats are attempting to sell their legislation with platitudes instead of what their bill actually does.

(1/2) <a href="https://youtu.be/kNxGCitKVzI">Impact of Continuing Resolutions on the Department of Defense and Services (EventID=114316)... | youtu.be</a> Continuing Resolutions increase waste &amp; inefficiency, and send a signal to our service members that their needs don't matter – but Republicans don't care. If they did, they'd come to the table &amp; negotiate in good faith. (2/2) Under Sec. of Defense McCord testified that under a Republican-forced yearlong CR, there's no legal way to spend $3 billion in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> funds. Without a funding deal, health care will fall short by more than $1 billion—jeopardizing care for military families during a pandemic. According to Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., Chief of Staff of the US Air Force, a yearlong CR would undermine modernization &amp; resiliency programs, such as $5.2 million intended for sexual assault &amp; sexual harassment prevention, and $900,000 to enhance suicide prevention programs. The testimony from the Services shows that under a full year CR, critical new research efforts would be at risk – including DoD-funded medical research and university research programs. Today's testimony from DoD leadership makes crystal clear that a Senate Republican-imposed yearlong CR is unprecedented &amp; devastating to every branch of service, service members, readiness, modernization, and our national security. In whole, it puts the American people at risk.</em>”</p>
