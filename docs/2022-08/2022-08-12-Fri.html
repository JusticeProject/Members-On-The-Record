As we celebrate this historic law, I want to share part of the story behind how we got it done — and highlight the heroes who made it possible. 1/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1557880659028459525/photo/1">Link to image</a> My work to help burn pit survivors began more than five years ago, when retired Army Captain @trooper1999 and his wife @ROSIETO59994621 visited my office in San Antonio to talk about the long-term consequences of burn pit exposure. 2/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1557880663277191169/photo/1">Link to image</a> During our nation's conflicts in the Middle East, the military used open-air burn pits to dispose of everything from munitions to medical waste.  These pits burned 24 hours a day, seven days a week, filling the air with toxic smoke. 3/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1557880666691354624/photo/1">Link to image</a> Le Roy Torres, a member of the Army Reserves, deployed to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> in 2007.   He came home with crushing headaches, dizziness, and a cough he couldn't shake. After a years-long effort to get diagnosed, he learned that burn pits were responsible for his illness. 4/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1557880670122393602/photo/1">Link to image</a> As Le Roy shared his story, I was shocked by how little the VA was doing to help veterans like him.   We have a sacred obligation to our veterans. The federal government shouldn't make them jump through hoops just to get basic care. 5/14 After our meeting, I organized forums across Texas to hear from veterans about the impact of burn pits on their health.  These men and women put their lives on the line for our country. But when they got sick, the VA wasn't prepared to care for them. 6/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1557880676883603456/photo/1">Link to image</a> One of the veterans I met was William Garza Jr., a brave Marine who enlisted after graduating from Los Fresnos High School in South Texas.  By the time I met him, William had cancer caused by his exposure to burn pits. He died at 38. 7/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1557880681178566659/photo/1">Link to image</a> With burn pits, I saw history repeating itself.  Decades ago, when Vietnam veterans came home with injuries caused by Agent Orange, they struggled to get the care they needed.  The government broke its promise to Vietnam veterans. This time, we had to do better. 8/14 In Congress, I was part of a growing coalition of legislators who were determined to make change.  In 2018, I introduced a bill to improve tracking of burn pit-related deaths &amp; illnesses. Over the next 4 years, I wrote and joined more than a dozen bills related to burn pits. 9/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1557880685716803584/photo/1">Link to image</a> This Congress, those efforts cumulated in the Honoring Our PACT Act, which was written to help generations of veterans, including Agent Orange survivors.  The Honoring Our PACT Act was bipartisan, bicameral legislation, and veterans were counting on us to get it passed. 10/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1557880689906810882/photo/1">Link to image</a> Earlier this year, the Honoring Our PACT Act passed the House and Senate, leaving just a handful of procedural hurdles to clear before it could become law.  But at the last minute, 25 Republican senators changed their minds and voted to block the bill from moving forward. 11/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1557880693325193216/photo/1">Link to image</a> In response, Rosie Torres and other advocates rallied in front of the Capitol, calling on the Senate to do the right thing.  After their show of strength, the Honoring Our PACT Act got the votes it needed. 12/14 <a href="https://twitter.com/JoaquinCastrotx/status/1557880697607577601/photo/1">Link to image</a> The Honoring Our PACT Act will change the lives of millions of veterans.
