No one knows how to engineer &amp; produce vehicles better than we do in Michigan, &amp; that includes military vehicles. We're so proud to show her the innovation happening with some of the ground vehicles being designed &amp; made right here.¬†1/ <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1557208053434441728/photo/1">Link to image</a> 2/ We started with a tour of some of the new vehicle technology at the Detroit Arsenal. After 3 tours in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> alongside our ground forces, it's amazing to see how far our vehicles have come - from countermeasure enhancements to improved armor, the difference is night &amp; day. 3/ We also toured the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Ground Vehicle Systems Center (DEVCON GVSC) &amp; BAE Systems in Sterling Heights. One particularly nice note: we got to recognize the great work done by the teams there to help support the efforts in Ukraine. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1557208066290065408/photo/1">Link to image</a> 4/ But here's what stood out:  more &amp; more of the fleet of fighting vehicles in development &amp; production today are electric. The environmental benefits are great, but everyone led with how the EVs provided better performance: more horsepower without the need to refuel. 5/ And it was particularly poignant to be having this visit on the same day that the CHIPS Act was signed into law. Military vehicles need the same kind of microchips as the cars and trucks we make in Michigan. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1557208075307720704/photo/1">Link to image</a> 6/ And Given the Pentagon's strict buy-American requirements for contractors, making these chips here, in the U.S., is critical for our military &amp; our national security.</em>‚Äù</p>
