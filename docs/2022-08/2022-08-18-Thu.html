That trip reinforced what I've long believed: any withdrawal of troops should have been based on facts on the ground.  The precipitous withdrawal last year, which I opposed when it was announced that spring, was the result of failures by multiple administrations. We know today that the Taliban continues to threaten the safety and rights of Afghan women and girls, and allowed Ayman al-Zawahri - one of the architects of 9/11 who our military and intelligence community took out last month - to live in Kabul.
