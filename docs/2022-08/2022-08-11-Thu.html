What he fails to realize is that (a) and (b) don't matter if (c) is true. 3/ From the start, we didn't understand Afghanistan, a country wildly different from and more complicated than <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span>.  And our structure of rotating generals and soldiers in and out 12 months at a time meant that we were destined to never learn Afghanistan. 4/ Every time I visited Afghanistan, a new smart general would explain to me why the previous general screwed up and how his new plan (derived from maybe 30 days of on-the-ground learning) would get things on the right track. 5/ The "can do" spirit of our military is its greatest strength and liability. In Afghanistan, the military's failed to understand that a paper thin understanding of Afghan culture and society was destined to lead to planning failure. But, admirably, they couldn't accept failure. 6/ But if you don't know how to properly spend money, who to partner with, how to build sustainable governments, etc, than there's no amount of money that will fix a fundamentally flawed strategy. 7/ More importantly, there was likely NEVER going to be a plan - even if it was informed by a better cultural understanding - that could impose a foreign power's will on Afghanistan. Sometimes, there is no American plan that will work. 8/ For centuries, the Afghans have resisted conquest and control. The power and strength of the instinct to fight America and the West was always going to be stronger than the willingness to work with us.  Resistance is in the soul of Afghanistan. 9/ Finally, there was no world in which Biden could have just "stuck it out". That would have required tens of thousands more troops and a resumption of deadly fighting with the Taliban.  And the design flaws of the first 20 years wouldn't have vanished if we stayed longer. 10/ The invasion of Afghanistan was just. But the right path would have been a quicker exit rather than a 20 year occupation.   The continued magical thinking that we could have won Afghanistan if we stayed longer is bound to get us into trouble later.   Hubris breeds hubris.</em>‚Äù</p>

American credibility with allies and partners has still not recovered after the Biden Admin's hazardous withdrawal from #<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. The admin also refuses to accept responsibility for the bungled evacuation. It's clear it hasn't learned lessons from this catastrophe. It's been a year &amp; we have yet to see any comprehensive reports or policy corrections. The admin should focus on developing a comprehensive counterterrorism plan, safeguarding #humanrights, &amp; creating guardrails on U.S. assistance to prevent direct benefit to the #Taliban.
