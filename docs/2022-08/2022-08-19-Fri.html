Here's my story #NY12    <a href="https://twitter.com/CarolynBMaloney/status/1493985202955292678/video/1">Link to video</a> I authored the Credit Cardholders' Bill of Rights (Credit CARD Act) which banned practices that have been determined to be unfair, deceptive and anti-competitive by the Federal Reserve.   This legislation has saved the public over $16 billion a year. I've succeeded in passing over 75 pieces of legislation, either as stand-alone bills, or as language incorporated into moving legislation.  I work for you &amp; am able to look you in the eye &amp; say, with zero hesitation, that I am going to get it done. Actions speak louder than words I've been the 1st woman to hold every seat I've ever had, including Chair of the House Oversight Committee.  Women have come a long way, but we're under attack by extremists who want to take us back 50 years.  I will not quit until we ensure women always have a seat at the table. Wanna talk about a long fight?   Since 1998, I've led the effort to create a museum dedicated to the contributions women have made throughout the history of the United States on the National Mall.  Nobody can tell me something can't be accomplished and in 2020, I got it done! With so many Republican legislatures trying to teach students about the views of Nazis, I want to remind them that I was able to pass the ‚ÄúNever Again Education Act‚Äù.  This bill expanded the U.S. <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Holocaust</span> Memorial Museum's education programming to teachers nationwide. I wrote the 2004 Debbie Smith law that eliminates the rape kit backlog. Hailed as the ‚Äòthe most important anti-rape legislation ever signed into law.'‚Äù  This has brought justice to hundreds of thousands of women who were sexually assaulted. It took over 10 years to secure healthcare for our 9/11 first responders and survivors. But I didn't give up and now they have health care for life. I fought tooth and nail for the funding for the 2nd Avenue Subway and it got built. Now I'm working to make sure we complete the project and extend it to 125th Street. üöá.</em>‚Äù</p>
