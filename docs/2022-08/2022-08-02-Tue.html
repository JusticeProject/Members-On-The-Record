So many local people dragged through the streets. 3/ ISIS, and many other groups inspired by al Qaeda, can draw a direct lineage from Zawahiri. And as someone who joined the CIA because I happened to be in New York on 9/11, I also know how many years of hard work it has taken to bring him to bring him this end. 4/ For decades, he was second only to UBL in leading al Qaeda. Tonight's news is a testament to the tireless work of our intelligence community and military, who have been looking him for so long. 5/ Targeting one senior leader does not end the capacity of an organization to attack, but it does send a message that, while it may take years, we do not forget those who attack us. I commend the President for making the tough call &amp; the national security team for this success.</em>”</p>

He developed skin and sinus issues, diabetes and exhaustion from this exposure, but had to wait 2 years in the VA system for a response. The #PACTAct would finally get him the care he deserves. Harry is a Navy veteran who was exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam and developed kidney cancer. He had to have his kidney removed and has been suffering with pain ever since only to meet endless red tape. The #PACTAct cuts that red tape and connects him to care. Berryl is an Army veteran of more than two decades exposed to toxic materials at home and around the world, and who has since developed cancer, nerve damage, anxiety and depression. She fought through breast cancer and has had to bring in lawyers to get the care she needs.

But Ukraine is causing problems for weak Dems upcoming re-elections, and the complaints are loud.  They even pivoted back to killing an old Al Qaeda terrorist so Biden could murmur his tough guy talk claiming he led the killing of Zawahiri.  Cont'd Great thanks and congratulations to those who killed Zawahiri, but after Biden humiliated our military tucking tail pulling out of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>, got 13 of our young soldiers killed, abandoned Americans, and armed the Taliban, Biden should be impeached NOT taking credit! Although many are asking good questions.  If we were in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> for so many years, why is it we just found out where Zawahiri is and finally killed him?  What trade was made for that Intel?  Is there proof he was killed?  It was recently reported he was sick and dying. And with Ukraine barely registering in polls with voters, even angering most bc of the $54 billion Congress voted to spend while our country tanks in a recession, record high crime, &amp; a national crisis from a Democrat approved daily border invasion, Pelosi is stepping in. Pelosi is an expert political operative and strategist.  Her trip to Taiwan appears “stunning and brave” and is fooling many, even our side.  Americans see China as our ultimate enemy, and daring war w/China has people flocking to her defense, but anger at China's aggressive.. posture and military warnings cloud people's judgement and cause them not to recognize what her pre-planned trip to Taiwan is all about.  Her CHIPS bill passed in the House, &amp; she is delivering US taxpayer funded corporate welfare to countries in Asia in return for job welfare.. for poor struggling middle class Americans who should be “grateful” to her for the semi-conductor manufacturing jobs that foreign country's companies will be giving to Americans by building their plants here.  Only a few decades ago, it was the opposite.  Our US manufacturers.. built manufacturing plants in many third world countries providing jobs (cheap labor) to poor people in foreign countries, and Americans lost their manufacturing jobs at home.  This destroyed the middle class and led to the slow decay of small towns all over America.  Cont'd This is the culmination of America Last and the most insulting slap in the face and punch in the gut to wonderful working class Americans.  That politicians would sell them out in such purely disgusting ways all while making them pay for it.  Cont'd Pelosi has led the America Last Elite Globalists First movement her entire career, and her stunt triggering China is not stunning and brave.  It's selfish, stupid, and politically motivated for power and money.  She doesn't care how many of our military she puts in harms way, to her, they are just pawns on her chess board.  This is the same woman who refused Pres Trump's and other's requests for the National Guard on Jan 6th, ignoring the Intel provided to her, and didn't care who or what happened that day, as long as she could use it to hurt Trump. This is the same woman who was a stay at home mom before she became a politician, and is now a grandmother, but led the House to pass a bill that allows unborn babies to be slaughtered up until the day of birth.  All to quiet the radical mob in her conference, so that.. they can please their donors in the evil abortion lobby.  This is the same woman who rest easy and never worries about a bad person causing her harm bc she is provided protection by guards armed with “weapons of war” AR-15's, the same guns that she led the House to ban.. innocent law abiding gun owners from owning to protect themselves.  So for anyone who thinks Pelosi cares about freedom, protecting the innocent, democracy, America's future, you are being fooled by one of the most skilled talented deceitful politicians of our time.</em>”</p>
