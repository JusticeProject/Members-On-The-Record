Iran continues to spread terror &amp; violence around the world, commit egregious human rights violations, &amp; undermine the int'l rules-based order. Iran is the largest state-sponsor of terrorism. Iranian-backed terrorist groups around the world murder civilians, threaten the US and our allies &amp; partners, and attack critical infrastructure that powers the int'l economy with funds &amp; weapons sourced directly from Iran. This past week, PIJ, a terrorist group funded by Iran, fired hundreds of rockets at <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>i cities, at least 60 of which fell short &amp; endangered Palestinians in Gaza. The U.S.-backed Iron Dome protected <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>i cities &amp; civilians and saved <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>i and Palestinian lives. Iran &amp; Russia work together to advance their malicious goals &amp; undermine US interests. Iran is supplying Russia w/ deadly drones to be used in Ukraine, and Russia &amp; Iran plan to launch a satellite which will be used to spy on targets in Ukraine &amp; across the Middle East. The Iranian regime systematically commits horrific human rights abuses. Iran regularly takes Americans hostage for political gain, like my constituent Bob Levinson, savagely cracks down on political opposition, and persecutes the Baha'i &amp; other religious minorities. Iran is rapidly advancing its nuclear program, recently said it has the capability to build a nuclear bomb, &amp; continues to flout its safeguards obligations after IAEA BoG censure. This escalation destabilizes the Mid East &amp; threatens the int'l nuclear non-proliferation movement. The US has worked w/ our allies &amp; partners to lead a remarkably effective response to Russia's illegal and unjust invasion of Ukraine. The US must lead a similarly robust &amp; comprehensive int'l effort to address Iran's nuclear program and the entirety of its malicious behavior.</em>‚Äù</p>
