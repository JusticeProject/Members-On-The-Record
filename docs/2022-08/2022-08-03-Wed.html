I introduced my component of this package more than a year ago to cut red tape at the VA to make it easier for veterans to get critical care for burn pit exposure — knowing it will soon be law is incredible. 4/ As a CIA officer, I lived near burn pits on three tours in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span>, and given my husband's 30 years of service in the Army, this one is really personal to me. 5/ Congress failed to live up to our commitment to veterans exposed to Agent Orange after Vietnam. By passing this landmark bill, we're sending the message that we will not make the same mistake again with the post-9/11 generation of American veterans. 6/ I'm so grateful to the tireless veterans, family members, VSOs and activists - in Michigan and around the country - who have fought so hard, with everything they have, to make this moment a reality.
