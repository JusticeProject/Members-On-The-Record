My thoughts are especially with the friends and family of the 2,461 service members who lost their lives throughout war, including the 13 Americans killed facilitating the evacuation of more than 124,000 people from <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> last August. I'm grateful @POTUS refused to send another generation of Americans off to fight in a war that should have ended long ago. The recent strike on al-Zawahiri demonstrates the US does not need troops on the ground to protect American counterterrorism interests. I also commend efforts to relocate more than 80,000 Afghans, repatriate hundreds of Americans &amp; provide humanitarian aid to the Afghan people. One year later, the work of helping <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> recover from 20 years of war is far from over.

AR police deserve our gratitude, and I thanked the Pea Ridge Police Dept for their work to protect and serve. We also remember Officer Kevin Apple, who was <span class="MOTR_Keyword">kill</span>ed in the line of duty last year. <a href="https://twitter.com/rep_stevewomack/status/1559299181998645249/photo/1">Link to image</a> Officers talked to me and @CityofPeaRidge Mayor Crabtree about force equipment and training. Law enforcement is often the first to respond to various emergencies and situations. They shared how NARCAN has allowed them to save lives and reduce the number of overdose tragedies. <a href="https://twitter.com/rep_stevewomack/status/1559299191687577600/photo/1">Link to image</a> We then stopped by @zipline to see the latest on their autonomous aircrafts taking flight in the Third District. This first-of-its-kind <span class="MOTR_Keyword">drone</span> delivery service in Northwest Arkansas is leveraging technology to revolutionize delivery and make quick, on-demand drop-offs a reality! <a href="https://twitter.com/rep_stevewomack/status/1559299204115226624/photo/1">Link to image</a> Here is a video of a @zipline take-off in action! <a href="https://twitter.com/rep_stevewomack/status/1559299248490962944/video/1">Link to video</a> I also visited the new Walmart Health Center in Rogers. The facility is a one-stop shop for Arkansans. It offers primary and urgent medical care, as well as dental, optometry, and other health services. Their comprehensive approach is all about improving overall #AR3 wellness. <a href="https://twitter.com/rep_stevewomack/status/1559299257777405952/photo/1">Link to image</a></em>”</p>
