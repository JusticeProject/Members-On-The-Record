For a detailed account of this perilous 10 days, see here. 1/ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/interactive/2021/kabul-airlift-afghans-escape/">A convoy to the Kabul airport, hostile Taliban and the faint hope that the gates to escape would swing open... | washingtonpost.com</a> 2/ Of all the things I've gotten to work on over the last 4 years, few were as harrowing, or as meaningful, especially since over 70 of these folks were affiliated with @MichiganStateU. 3/ Another 30+ were former Deputy Ministers, staff &amp; military officers of the former Afghan government who were threatened by the Taliban. All had worked for or with Americans &amp; risked their lives helping us. 4/ Today is the anniversary of the first of the three major chapters in their story, and certainly the most terrifying part of the effort: a 10-day odyssey that culminated in getting a caravan through the gates at Kabul Airport, wheels-up out of Afghanistan ... 5/ ... and landed in the generous country of Albania, which would become their short-term home. 6/ Those 10 days — from being inundated with thousands of desperate calls, to finding someone to rent buses, to arranging secret meeting spots, to dodging gun shots, making it through Taliban checkpoints, and finding the right military friends to let us in the gates … 7/ … only happened because a broad network of people around the world — some of whom I knew and others  I've still never met — felt a deep connection to these Afghans &amp; stepped up to help. 8/ Many had or were serving in Afghanistan and put their energy and frustrations with the withdrawal into getting people out. 9/ So why did this group end up Albania? Frankly, kismet. When I couldn't confirm that I could get them out on a military plane, we bartered with other remarkable groups to get a charter plane to take them out. 10/ Once we got them through the gates of the airport, we had to figure out where to take them — and that's when my staff and I started googling. We figured out which countries were taking in Afghans, and who their US ambassadors were. 11/ Amazingly, @USAmbAlbania Yuri Kim and I worked on <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> together over a decade ago, and I reached out to her. We formally asked Prime Minister @ediramaal &amp; Foreign Minister @xhacka_olta of Albania to accept out Afghans, and give them safe harbor. 12/ Five hours after the Prime Minister signed off, the Foreign Minister met the plane at the airport in Tirana. Most of the Afghans had barely heard of Albania when the landed there - exhausted to start the second chapter of the story. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepSlotkin/status/1563549534193852419/photo/1">Link to image</a> 13/ I would meet them in Albania a few months later, while the amazing team at @SpiritAmerica cared for them in their time of need. <a href="https://spiritofamerica.org/blog/a-new-home-for-the-afghan-evacuees">Afghanistan to Albania to America: A new home for the Afghan evacuees... | spiritofamerica.org</a> 14/ While no one was proud of the way we left Afghanistan, 1 year ago today I was proud of my team &amp; the people who played a part in this mission to do something — anything — we could to help those who helped us. More on chapter 2, the Albanian odyssey, coming soon.</em>”</p>
