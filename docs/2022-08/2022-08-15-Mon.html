America is just as angered and frustrated at Joe Biden's disastrous <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> withdrawal today as we were the day it occurred. Over the last year, Biden and his incompetent administration have tried every way possible to escape accountability. We've seen the State Department obstruct the independent, congressionally mandated oversight of the withdrawal. Secretary Blinken can't seem to get a number straight on how many Americans are still stranded without U.S. assistance. To further our frustrations, we recently learned Al-Qaeda has reemerged in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. We won't stop working until every question is answered, every American is safe at home, every piece of U.S. equipment is recovered or destroyed, and the Biden Administration is held fully accountable for their dereliction of duty. <a href="https://steube.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-steube-s-statement-on-the-one-year-anniversary-of-the-fall-of-kabul">Rep.

The Biden Administration's calamitous decision to unilaterally end the war left American citizens behind and Afghans desperately clinging to the sides of aircraft departing Kabul. Over the past 12 months, the Taliban has shown the world why those Afghans were so desperate to leave. Thousands of SIV immigrants remain in limbo and tens of thousands of women and girls are being denied access to basic human rights and educational opportunities. And just last month, the American people learned that Ayman al-Zawahiri ‚Äì Osama Bin Laden's right hand man and a planner of the 9-11 attacks ‚Äì was living in downtown Kabul in a home owned by a leader in the Taliban Government. The safe harboring of known terrorists, a direct violation of the Doha Agreement, and the consequences of our hazardous withdrawal still have not cost a single person in the Biden Administration a job or demotion. On August 26, we will mark the solemn anniversary of the bombing in Kabul that killed 13 American service members, including Indiana's own Corporal Humberto ‚ÄúBert‚Äù Sanchez. These heroes were working in the chaos around the airport to rescue innocent Afghans. It is long past time for the Biden Administration to face accountability for the numerous mistakes that occurred last year. I look forward to the bipartisan Commission that I authored together with @SenDuckworth to get underway soon. We must learn from the mistakes that occurred.</em>‚Äù</p>
