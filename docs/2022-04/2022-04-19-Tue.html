A now beloved biannual community event, "Fill Father Matt's Truck," is 1 of the ways Father Matt brings people together through service. A volunteer firefighter, Father Matt also works with thousands of NJ families experiencing homelessness, delivering homemade meals, organizing free laundry nights, and during COVID-19, teaching them how to stay safe from the virus. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAndyKimNJ/status/1516131300398272521/photo/1">Link to image</a> With every family helped, Father Matt's passion, understanding, and love for our community grows.   In partnership with his parish, Father Matt's efforts quickly expanded and took him to @jointbasemdl. Before COVID-19, Father Matt, Christ Church, &amp; volunteers from Bordentown came together each month to cook meals for troops living in the Joint Base dorms.   When COVID made this no longer possible, Father Matt knew that their work could not stop, it would just have to change. Last summer, when our <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span> allies arrived at the Joint Base as refugees, Father Matt knew he could bring together the Bordentown community to help. He began collecting supplies and partnered with other churches, community organizations, neighbors, and nonprofits to change the lives of these families who were suddenly and traumatically in very unfamiliar surroundings. The community's response was astounding. Father Matt shared that he truly believes people want to help others and do good, sometimes they just don't know how.   He now sees it as his duty to give his neighbors these opportunities. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAndyKimNJ/status/1516131315590082563/photo/1">Link to image</a> Service is at the heart of Father Matt's faith. It informs his work and passions.  From his experiences, he firmly believes that service is what brings neighbors closer together and can truly change the lives of people who need it most. #ServiceSpotlight</em>”</p>
