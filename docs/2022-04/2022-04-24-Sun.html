A THREAD ⬇️ <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorHassan/status/1517927885612462080/photo/1">Link to image</a> An <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> War veteran, Eric McNail returned home to Littleton and requires assistance with daily activities, and his wife Jennifer has been his constant caregiver. (2/8) They were one of the first New Hampshire families to receive assistance as part of the VA Caregivers Program, providing veterans and their caregivers mental health counseling, respite care, and caregiver education and training. (3/8) The program has been a lifeline for them.  However, they were kicked off after eligibility requirements were narrowed by the previous administration. (4/8) Despite years of participation in the program, Eric and Jennifer saw their support removed.  They fought back, organized with peers, and appealed the VA's decisions. (5/8) I heard from the McNails and other veterans, and since launched a bipartisan effort to reverse changes in eligibility and ensure that Eric, Jennifer, and thousands of veterans and their families can continue to receive care that they need after they return from service. (6/8) I was glad to see the VA announce in March that they will not remove anyone from the program before they reexamine the eligibility criteria, and I will keep pushing to ensure that veterans can stay in the program permanently. (7/8) Read more about the McNails, their advocacy, and my bipartisan push to protect benefits for veterans who have sacrificed for our country.
