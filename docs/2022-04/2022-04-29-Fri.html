When we kill civilians, we're not only taking innocent life, we're recruiting another generation to take up arms against us. This is a major problem and has been for a long time. One of our very last military actions in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> was a drone strike that killed 10 civilians and targeted a vehicle that was not a threat. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I have been incredibly frustrated by a lack of transparency and a lack of accountability at the Pentagon on civilian casualties. The process is broken and we need major reforms. That's why I joined colleagues in the House and Senate in introducing two bills to increase transparency and improve our efforts to protect civilians, including stronger reporting and investigation requirements and coordination across the military. Glad to be leading this effort with @SenWarren, @RepRoKhanna, @RepJasonCrow and @RepMalinowski ‚Äî and to have the support of more than 15 human rights groups, veterans' organizations, and other groups.

I met with his family many times...His parents are very grateful. "We are currently witnessing the largest invasion in Europe since World War II, my father's war. And as you know, the brutality is shocking. Images of corpses littering the streets of Bucha, hands tied behind their backs and bullets in their heads. These are Putin's war crimes. "And he must be held accountable. Yet in the face of these horrors, President @ZelenskyyUa and the people of Ukraine have really inspired the world with their bravery and determination...They are standing in front of tanks, risking their lives to fight for their freedom. "I appreciate the efforts made to get these desperately needed weapons into the hands of Ukrainians once the war started...But the president sat on critical weapons packages in the Spring of 2021 and again in November 2021 ‚Äì all while Russia amassed troops on the border. "And as the Battle for the Donbas heats up, the Unite States and our allies are only just now training Ukrainians on vital heavy weapons, including MLRS, artillery, air defenses, armed drones and tanks...As Pres. Zelensky put it 'Help save the lives of thousands of Ukrainians.' "Russia's unprovoked attack on Ukraine has opened the world's eyes to the threat of other malign actors ‚Äì primarily China to our partner Taiwan...It's not a question of IF the CCP tries to take over Taiwan. It's a question of WHEN...The US must act now to prevent [this]. "Turning to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>. As Republicans and Democrats alike expressed alarm over the administration's failure to prepare for the fallout of the withdrawal, we were promised this administration had 'planned for all contingencies.' "But in the end, 13 U.S. soldiers died during the evacuation. And hundreds of American citizens and tens of thousands of Afghan partners were left behind. I will be releasing an interim report very soon outlining what our investigation has discovered so far."</em>‚Äù</p>
