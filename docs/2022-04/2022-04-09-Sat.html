Thread: 1/ This has been bugging me over the last few months as the situation in Ukraine has made supply side (aka: drill-baby-drill) voices ascendant and the voices calling for conservation have lost their self-confidence and mojo 2/ A big part of this relates to the background of folks who talk energy and enviro policy in DC.  People who come from the energy sector too often assume that there is a direct link between energy demand, energy supply and economic growth. 3/ BUT... folks who come from the enviro sector too often assume that since burning fuel creates pollution, any path to environmental protection must entail some degree of economic self sacrifice 4/ I am of course over-simplifying, but not by much.  The conventional wisdom says that we live in a market economy that rationally allocates resources.  It's impossible to waste fuel because markets would never allow that.  Or so the theory goes. 5/ The problem with that theory is that the only people who think the energy sector operates in a perfect, undistorted market are people who've never worked in the energy market. $5.9 trillion/year of global subsidies has a way of distorting markets... <a href="https://www.power-technology.com/news/imf-fossil-subsidies/#:~:text=Analysis%20by%20the%20International%20Monetary,breaks%20accounting%20for%20another%206%25">IMF: fossil fuel industry the recipient of subsidies of $5.9tn per year... | power-technology.com</a>. 6/ The truth is that - in the words of Amory Lovins - what people want is a cold beer and a hot shower.  And they'd like to pay as little for it as possible.  Cutting fossil fuel inputs is economically accretive as long as the access to hot water and cold pilsners stays the same. 7/ You can't wrap your head around the impact of $5.9T/year of market distortion, and so we all underappreciate the massive degree to which our society makes really bad, suboptimal capital allocation decisions.  We all underestimate our potential. 8/ My friend @EconSkip however has done a great job of showing how energy efficiency - using less input fuel to provide more useful light and heat - has been the single biggest source of new energy in the US for decades - and is still woefully under-tapped. <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1512805440677105664/photo/1">Link to image</a> 9/ In fact, it's even bigger than that.  Economists "know" that boosting labor productivity (more output/input) grows the economy.  @EconSkip has made the obvious parallelism that boosting energy productivity is also a really big deal! <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1512805998288846852/photo/1">Link to image</a> 10/ Note the units on this chart.  GDP per unit of primary energy.  This isn't just LED lights and better insulation.  It's everything from renewables to cutting gas flares to industrial motor upgrades to fuel economy upgrades.  Boost that ratio and we boost per capita income 11/ To give a feeling for the potential, the US efficiency in the prior chart is just HALF of the efficiency of the UK.  It's only a THIRD of the efficiency of Switzerland.  We are getting our butt kicked not because we lack the technology - we're just wasteful. 12/ That means that if we got to the level Switzerland has already achieved we could cut US CO2 emissions by at least 70% AND grow our economy.  There's no good reason not to do so EXCEPT that it would hurt those folks who depend on all those subsidies. 13/ So now let's bring this back to Ukraine.  The Oxford Institute for Energy Studies has done some interesting analysis of how the world will respond to the loss of 1 - 3 million barrels per day of oil supply from Russia.  It ain't pretty: <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1512808117175820294/photo/1">Link to image</a> 14/ Note this isn't a policy recommendation. It's just math.  You can't get there without making hard choices about <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>, Saudi, etc.   And the US isn't really all that significant.  (Source: <a href="https://a9w7k6q9.stackpathcdn.com/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Russias-invasion-of-Ukraine-and-global-oil-market-scenarios.pdf">Link to PDF | a9w7k6q9.stackpathcdn.com</a>) 15/ So if the US can't meet the supply and the supply can't come on quickly, why are so many US politicos pushing that path?  Because their interest is in furthering our fossil dependency so that energy extraction companies can sell at the highest possible price. 16/ As I said here, you can't find anyone in the @GOP who ever argues for boosting oil supply or cutting oil demand.  Their interests are transparently about price increases, not economic growth.  <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1510224681583919104?s=20&t=RDpSZ9A8yDItrBaD7MSoRA">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">Imagine a world where Fox News praises the President for negotiating a deal that raised the price of oil by 24%.   That of course, was what happened 2 years ago today, and we need to talk about it to understand the @GOP hypocrisy about today's gasoline prices.  Thread:</span></a> 17/ But for those of us who care about the environment, we have to be much more fluent in the potential for greater efficiency - and much more willing to lean into it's potential to grow our economy AND save our planet.  Because it's the only chance we've got.  /fin <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1512810195755446274">Link to reply<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">@SeanCasten Important to be clear though that this is all a long term discussion at this point. Efficiency in the oil case means efficiency in transport. Takes decades. That's a good reason to get started on more ambitious policy right away, but not going to help with the current crisis.</span></a> @samori8 Two responses: first, don't underestimate the degree to which oil is used for industrial and heating purposes.  Oxford analysis shows that ~50% of demand destruction in their 3 MBPD case <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanCasten/status/1512815127669706753/photo/1">Link to image</a> @samori8 Second, we can't ramp up production without spending time building new infrastructure either. That's why there's a time delay on the ramp in comment 13 above.  So we have a very real question now about WHAT we build in the near term.  Investments to boost supply or reduce demand? @samori8 That should be a no brainer choice to prioritize the latter, but - for all the reasons noted above - folks chronically under-estimate the potential for economically accretive FF demand destruction @samori8 (Note that the demand reduction in the Oxford analysis is - as far as I can tell - an assumption about market responses to higher prices, not an assumption that we will make intentional investments to accelerate the reduction)</em>‚Äù</p>
