Here's what we're doing and what's still needed. <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/?state=NJ">AAA Gas Prices... | gasprices.aaa.com</a> Russia normally exports 4.5 million barrels of crude oil per day. Because of the invasion and our sanctions, up to 3 million of those barrels could be off the market. So to get prices down, we have to at least replace that amount. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/16/oil-market-heads-for-biggest-supply-crisis-in-decades-with-russias-exports-set-to-fall-iea-says.html">Oil market heads for 'biggest supply crisis in decades' with Russia's exports set to fall, IEA says | cnbc.com</a> The US and our allies are now releasing around 1.3 million barrels a day from our reserves. I'm told US oil companies could ramp up production by another 1 million a day on their existing leases, but that will take months, because they did not start this process soon enough. Oil companies are enjoying the high prices, posting record profits last quarter, and not yet passing the full savings of lower oil prices down to us. So I've cosponsored a bill to slap a temporary oil windfall profit tax to fund a rebate for consumers. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/exxon-signals-record-quarterly-profit-oil-gas-prices-2022-04-04/">Exxon signals record quarterly profit from oil and gas prices... | reuters.com</a> Meanwhile the oil companies are lobbying us to give them even more drilling leases on our public lands and coastlines. For New Jersey, that would mean oil rigs off the Jersey shore, but no new production for years -- so zero impact on today's gas prices. No way! Instead, we should be pressuring companies to start or resume production on the thousands of unused leases they already have. We should cut the time they have to use leases before they lose them, and raise the lease rate (which is just $1.50 per acre).<a href="https://www.doi.gov/ocl/oil-and-gas-leasing-program">Oil and Gas Leasing Program | U.S. Department of the Interior</a> As we wait for more US oil to enter the market, the only other countries that can quickly replace the lost Russian crude are <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> Arabia and the UAE. But they are still protecting Russia, even as we protect their oil fields and shipping lanes. They need to choose sides fast. The oil cartel and companies may view this crisis as their last chance to make a killing before cheaper renewable energy dominates the market. I hope they're right!  We need them now. But let's make America the world's clean energy superpower so we're never at their mercy again.</em>‚Äù</p>
