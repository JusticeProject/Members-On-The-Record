Gas prices are near all-time highs and heating costs have been out of control this winter. And what's the Biden administration telling American families to do about it? ¬† Go buy a $50,000 electric car. Our enemies around the world are on the march, with Biden's weak foreign policy leading to disasters in Afghanistan &amp; in Ukraine and emboldening our adversaries. And what's the Biden administration's answer? ¬† They're attempting to resurrect the failed <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span> Nuclear Deal. There is a crisis at our nation's Southern border. More than 7,000 people every day are encountered at our Southern border. And guess what? ¬† Now, Joe Biden wants to lift Title 42, which ‚Äì according to his own administration ‚Äì would lead those numbers to surge to 18,000 per day.

Last year alone, they were able to help 12,000+ children, adults &amp; seniors with food assistance, addiction support, &amp; psychological counseling. With this funding, they will be able to help even more here in #PBC.

In #China, the #CCP is actively committing a genocide against the #Uyghur people &amp; other ethnic minorities. Torture, extrajudicial detention, and transnational repression remain common practices of the CCP. #CCPrisoners #Maduro survives in #Venezuela through systemic and violent attacks on #humanrights and independent civil society. The Biden Administration must not ease pressure on the Maduro regime without irreversible steps towards freedom for Venezuelans. In #Nicaragua, #Ortega has attacked and dismantled the last remnants of free institutions, ramped up his efforts to target and detain political opposition, and silenced any dissent. Nicaraguans have no freedom of expression. After the bungled and haphazard withdrawal from #<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> in August, the #Taliban has shown the world it is not committed to #humanrights, including those of women &amp; girls. All Afghans should be free to dissent, attend school, &amp; exercise their fundamental rights. In #Belarus, civil society actors, #humanrights advocates, NGOs, and others face severe government harassment. #Putin's cronies continue to quash the human rights of those inside Belarus, and with the help of government forces, those in #Ukraine as well. Each year, @StateDept highlights #humanrights abuses in #Zimbabwe, yet little changes in U.S. policy toward the #ZANUPF even as our gov't pledges solidarity w/ the Zimbabwean people. The two are not mutually exclusive. A policy shift is needed before the 2023 polls. The #humanrights abuses in #Burundi under the current gov't must stand on their own ‚Äì not in comparison to the former #Nkurunziza regime. As the Biden Admin keenly pursues US reengagement w/ #Burundi, it should show the same eagerness to hold the gov't accountable for its abuses. The United States will always advocate for those who cannot advocate for themselves. We will continue to work to hold accountable those who abuse their power, and we will continue to support justice for all. <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/risch-on-state-departments-2021-human-rights-reports">Risch on State Department's 2021 Human Rights Reports | United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations</a></em>‚Äù</p>
