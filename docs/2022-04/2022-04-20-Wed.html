To the Social Media staffer writing tweets for President Butter Beans:  To decrease utility bills, we must build more nuclear plants, increase clean coal for energy, drill for US oil &amp; gas, and stop the Green New Deal.  You don't see our enemies worshipping your climate gods. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/potus/status/1516752539311616001">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">Beyond gas prices, I've called on Congress to move immediately to lower the cost of families' utility bills, prescription drugs, and more — while lowering the deficit to reduce inflationary pressure.   That would make a big difference for families.</span></a> 2. Prescription drug cost will drastically decrease when we cut out the middle man.  Obamacare should be repealed and real market competition should return to the healthcare industry.  And we must make critical medications here in the USA, not buy them from China. 3. And to decrease inflation, Congress must stop spending TRILLIONS paying people to stay home and not go to work, bailing out big corporations, and NEVER AGAIN SHUTDOWN PRIVATE BUSINESSES.  Stop printing money and flooding it into the economy. 4. Stop enslaving the American people in debt to China, Japan, and other foreign countries who own our national debt.  Stop all foreign aid and funding foreign wars and foreign regime change.  Stop your stupid ideas like $10 billion to vaccinate the world to enrich big pharma. 5. Stop wasting a fortune of American's hard earned tax dollars on twisted ideology like gender studies in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Pakistan</span>.  Oh and how about stop funding biolabs that create bio weapons.  Stop giving grant money to politician's kids and friends for their businesses like Metabiota. 6. While we are at it, we should shrink the size of the federal government that is really the problem in the American people's lives.  Slash useless agencies like the BOE, ATF, and fire all lazy gov employees that stay home all day in their pajamas bc of the covid scam. 7. Make some money for a change by charging foreign countries for our military presence in their countries that keep them safe and allow them to not have to heavily fund their own military for their own national defense.  Like Germany. 8. Seems Germany's government (Federal Ministry of Education and Research) funds attacking our citizens like @libsoftiktok.  So why are US tax payers paying for our military base in their country defending them?  @libsoftiktok pays taxes.  <a href="https://thepostmillennial.com/german-government-funds-research-project-that-doxxed-libs-of-tik-tok">German government funds 'research' project that doxxed Libs of Tik Tok | The Post Millennial</a> 9.
