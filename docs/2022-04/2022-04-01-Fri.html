Biden is going to use the Defense Production Act to mine for rare earth minerals and build EV batteries.  They are going to use the power of the federal government and the taxpayers dollars to force Americans to EV's under the scam ‚Äúhelping Americans afford to drive.‚Äù 2. Biden abandoned $1 Trillion in rare earth minerals mines in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>.    The fool could have negotiated mining rights there especially since the US taxpayers paid to build the infrastructure for those mines in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>.  But no Biden just left it all there. 3. While American taxpayers have been funding billions in weapons to Ukraine, Biden could instead be negotiating for peace in Ukraine and for mining rights to the massive lithium stores in Ukraine.  But Biden's regime and the NWO still want war with Russia.  They ‚ù§Ô∏è regime change 4. While China holds over 85% mining rights to the worlds rare earth minerals, the Biden regime is forcing America onto the Green New Deal and whipping US taxpayers to pay for America to convert to EV's.  The US holds less than 5% market share in REM mines and EV batteries. 5. Biden is declaring a New World Order and Americans will be forced to blindly pay for it bc they have no idea what is happening and how drastically things will change.  Bulldozing over the natural flow of supply &amp; demand will have devastating consequences.  Democrats don't care 6. The Democrats have used the government to enhance their businesses for years through grants, policy decisions, and even laws.  All of it funds how they make money.  The federal government is fully corrupted and the money flows to fill the elites pockets. 7. Now they are doing it again on a massive scale with Biden using the Defense Production Act to funnel American taxpayer dollars into their Green New Deal and climate agenda driven businesses.   All while the skyrocketing inflation will soon make food cost unaffordable. 8. The rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. 9. Democrats are doing all of this yet have no effective plans to increase US energy production to supply all the extra electricity needs for their disastrous plans.  The wind doesn't blow everyday and the sun doesn't shine all the time everywhere.  Elections have consequences.</em>‚Äù</p>
