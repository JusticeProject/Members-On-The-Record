(1/15) Commenting on the budget ‚Äúdeal,‚Äù Senator Mitch McConnell stated that the ‚Äúnumber one priority of the United States‚Äù is to send another $45 billion to Ukraine to defend its borders.  I have news for @LeaderMcConnell: America has 99 problems but the Ukraine ain't one.  (2/15) Over five million illegals in two years and counting have broken our laws and illegally entered our country.  Fentanyl continues to pour in, killing more than 100,000 Americans last year. (3/15) Inflation is rampant.  Real wages are in decline. We have, for the first time since World War II, shortages of items and supply chain problems. We have record crime in many cities across the United States. (4/15) The Department of Justice is being weaponized. The FBI is engaged in illegal censorship and political persecution. We have a monopoly of Big Tech companies that engage in collusion with the FBI to censor, and punish, political dissidents. (5/15) We have the most direct evidence of political corruption contained on Joe Biden's son's laptop revealing illegal bribes from Ukraine and other governments, suppressed by the very law enforcement agencies charged with investigating these crimes. (6/15) We have broken families and a confused young populace wondering if they are a boy or girl and a sustained effort to eliminate Jesus Christ from our public sphere. We have men pretending to be women simply to win at sports. (7/15) We have failing infrastructure across our land. We have a crisis of confidence in our government and a two-tiered legal system, akin to an <span class="MOTR_Keyword">apartheid</span> state, that defines anarcho-tyranny. (8/15) We have elections in which both democrats and Republicans agree are riddled with incompetence, fraud, or both. We have a completely rigged system with election interference by the DOJ and the FBI against American citizens and against President Trump in particular. (9/15) We have inept public health officials who are responsible for malpractice on a scale never seen before resulting in over 100,000 deaths due to COVID-19 malpractice or due to an untested rushed vaccine that caused more harm than it prevented. (10/15) We have a failed military leadership that is preoccupied with promoting homosexuality and cross-dressing, and got its butt handed to it in a humiliating defeat in Afghanistan where we left men and women behind as well as over $80 billion in top notch military equipment. (11/15) We are broke, broken and over $31 trillion in debt and counting. (12/15) Yet the Omnibus bill failed to remedy a single one of these very real problems. Not one. In fact, it rewards the DOJ, the FBI and the failed military leadership with more money and no reforms and no investigations. Not a dime is allocated towards securing our own border. (13/15) These comments by a Republican are an insult to the American people that Mitch McConnell fails to represent. This is the epitome of America Last. In all my travels across Arizona, not one of my constituents said that defending Ukraine should be our top priority. Not one. (14/15) Congress should be looking at ways to solve the very real problems within our own borders. For these reasons, I will be voting against this bill when it is considered on the House floor later this week.  America First.  (15/15)</em>‚Äù</p>
