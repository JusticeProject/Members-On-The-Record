Let me tell you why this matters: üßµ On the Black Sea: This region is a crucial geopolitical inflection point in Europe, especially in the context of Putin's war in Ukraine. The U.S. needs a comprehensive strategy to address the problems of today and to prepare for the challenges of tomorrow. My bill w/ @SenatorRomney directs the admin to provide such a strategy so we can strengthen our partnerships w/ NATO &amp; Black Sea partners to counter Putin's escalating aggression in Europe, which we know extends beyond Ukraine's borders. On camps in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span>: The humanitarian &amp; security crises brewing in ISIS detainee &amp; displaced person camps in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span> demands our attention and action today. If the conditions in these camps go unchecked, we risk a resurgence of ISIS. We can't let that happen. We cannot allow terrorists to turn back the clock &amp; resurrect their campaign of terror that tore through the region, the aftershocks of which are still being felt today, and viciously took the lives of scores of civilians, including Americans like James Foley. My bill w/ Sen. Graham builds on my previous work to task a U.S. official responsible for overseeing camps &amp; detention facilities by elevating the seniority of the position &amp; expanding their mandate so it comprehensively addresses the systemic problems facing the camps. We face numerous security challenges around the globe and it's crucial that we work across the aisle to advance policies that preserve U.S. interests, stand by our partners &amp; maintain peace and stability around the globe. Both of these bills respond to significant national security concerns and Senate leadership should bring them to the floor for full consideration as swiftly as possible.</em>‚Äù</p>
