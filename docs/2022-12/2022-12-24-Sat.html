[1/7] At no time in modern history has the outgoing Majority in Congress - with one foot out the door - rammed through an omnibus spending package during a Lame Duck session. [2/7] This closing act will bring new spending totals, in just two short years of one-party Democrat control in Washington, to more than $5 trillion. [3/7] On November 8, the American people made their voices heard by voting in a new Republican Majority to the House of Representatives to curb the runaway spending that is fueling record-high prices and making our country less safe. [4/7] This reckless spending is a direct affront to the will of the voters. [5/7] The 4,126-page, $1.8 trillion spending spree takes the problem of record-high inflation from bad to worse and adds hundreds of billions more to our already massive national debt. [6/7] Among many ironies in this omnibus package is a provision barring @CBP from investing in proven methods to curb the flow of illegal drugs and migrants across our border while simultaneously investing $410M to secure the borders of Jordan, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Lebanon</span>, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman.
