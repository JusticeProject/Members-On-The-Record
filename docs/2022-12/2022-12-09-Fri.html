(THREAD) The annual pentagon spending bill now totals over $850 billion. That's more than $55 billion over what the President requested. It is unconscionable to spend a record-breaking amount on our defense budget while thousands of Minnesotans in my district struggle to make ends meet. Pentagon spending now totals more than transportation, veterans, education, justice, international affairs, the environment, housing, science, space, job training, and employment combined. Our spending priorities should reflect our values. It is not moral to spend more money on a Pentagon budget than we spend on priorities that impact the daily lives of my constituents. We have a responsibility to reduce our exorbitant military budget and spend more money on housing, education, childcare, and healthcare. Not only does this legislation further fund endless wars, but it continues to harm our reputation around the world. It includes egregious funding to extend the failed War on Drugs mentality in Colombia that has led to some of the worst human rights abuses in the world. It also prohibits the closing of Guantanamo and removes all congressional provisions related to the war in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Yemen</span>. Let's be clear: spending this much money on pentagon bloat does not make us safer. We can focus our energy on critical efforts‚Äîlike assisting the Ukrainian people in fighting off an illegal Russian invasion‚Äîwithout spending over $850 billion on wasteful contracts. For these reasons, I oppose this bill. Full statement here: <a href="https://omar.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-ilhan-omar-statement-national-defense-authorization-act-1">Rep.
