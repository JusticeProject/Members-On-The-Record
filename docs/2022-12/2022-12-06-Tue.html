It's where I had my bat mitzvah, and my brother attended the preschool in question.

I've spoken with Jewish leaders across the community this morning, and I think this incident offers two lessons: 3/ First, leadership climate in this country and in our community is set at the top. When government and cultural leaders feel free to express anti-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">semitism</span>, it becomes normalized ‚Äî and no one should be surprised when that hatred shows up at our doorstep. 4/ Secondly, people who are obsessed with hating others climb a ‚Äòladder of escalation'. They may start with hate online and climb to hate in public places ‚Äî and ultimately it can end up in violence, as we have seen in so many places across the country. 5/ It is therefore critical that we have a strong community and law enforcement response to these incidents. A strong response, as we've seen from Oakland County prosecutor McDonald, helps give pause to others filled with hate who may be thinking about acting on that hate. 6/ I want to thank our Jewish leaders from both Beth El and the greater community who have been working so hard to lead after this incident. We need your steady hand now more than ever.</em>‚Äù</p>
