You're saying this speech should never be allowed here.</span></a> @ggreenwald @Jamie_Maz @mdrayton @ShelbyTalcott I am saying that there are two principles. Free speech (non censoring) and respect for participants. Town hall has both. So someone has 1st amendment rights to go on a racist rant, but not at my town hall.
