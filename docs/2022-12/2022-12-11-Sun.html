Yet, millions of people live under oppressive regimes, like those of #China, #Russia, #<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>, #Venezuela, #Zimbabwe, &amp; others, that destroy free speech, press, assembly, &amp; religion. The #CCP is actively quashing dissent and abusing tech to further its authoritarian reach both in #China and abroad. Daring to dissent is a brave but dangerous act, and the #CCP will stop at nothing to punish those who do. #Russia's unjust detention of @vkaramurza is an attack on his &amp; the people of Russia's #humanrights. Vladimir Kara-Murza has risked his life to show Russia another way is possible. Though the Russian gov't doesn't, the U.S. continues to support the rights of the Russian people. It's disappointing POTUS turns the other cheek when discussing #humanrights in #Venezuela. #Maduro silences critics, harasses &amp; kills human rights defenders, &amp; detains Americans for political games. We must not let the regime dictate what is possible for the people of Venezuela. Recent peaceful protests in #<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span> show the strength of the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>ian people in their demands for basic rights like speech, press, religion, assembly, &amp; more. The regime's brutal crackdowns reinforce its status as a pariah state as the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>ian people demand change. In #Mali and the #CentralAfricanRepublic, security forces and their Wagner Group partners have committed atrocities, including killings &amp; torture. Such #humanrights abuses are fueling conflicts and humanitarian crises, resulting in greater suffering. #HumanRightsDay #SouthSudan's gov't spokesman is among those who dismiss credible reports in the country of rape, torture, killings, beheadings, &amp; burning people alive. The govt's failure to acknowledge these reports reflects its serious lack of concern for #humanrights. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-panel-accuses-regional-south-sudan-officials-overseeing-gang-rapes-beheadings-2022-11-28/">UN panel accuses regional South Sudan officials of overseeing gang rapes, beheadings... | reuters.com</a></em>‚Äù</p>
