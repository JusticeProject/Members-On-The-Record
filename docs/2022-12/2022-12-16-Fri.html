Congress passed it into law to strengthen America's response to the growing scourge of anti-AAPI hate, anti-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Semitism</span>, and white supremacist violence. 3/ We still are not seeing the progress we want on the law's larger goals of coordinating a better, data-driven response to prevent hate crimes.

Every law enforcement division at the local, state, and federal level should be reporting hate crimes through NIBRS.  5/ Congress spelled this out in a bipartisan law, and provided money to help departments adapt to that system.
