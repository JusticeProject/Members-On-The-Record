One look at his presidential transcripts and you'll see his time in the White House has been an abject failure. 🧵 On Day 1, Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline.    Over 700 days later, winter heating costs are surging to the highest level in 25 years.   Biden's solution? “No more drilling.” <a href="https://twitter.com/GReschenthaler/status/1608473426616020993/photo/1">Link to image</a> Inflation remains at a 40-year high.
