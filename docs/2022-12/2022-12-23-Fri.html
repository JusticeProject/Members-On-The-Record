This is exactly the same. Democrats waited til the last minute in a lame-duck Congress to dump a 4,000-page, $2 trillion bill into the lap of the American people. <a href="https://twitter.com/i/broadcasts/1lPKqBzQgEYGb">Kevin McCarthy... | twitter.com</a> To state the obvious, the omnibus spends too much, increasing the deficit and fueling even more inflation.  Our economy is already in dire condition, and jamming through this monstrosity supercharges that disaster. Second – the omnibus spending bill intensifies the crisis at our Southern border. It reduces the number of ICE detention beds and lowers funding for border technology to prevent crossings. Even worse: this bill sets aside $410 million for border security in Jordan, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Lebanon</span>, Egypt, Tunisia, and Oman. Radical Democrats will fund walls and technology to protect the Middle East but not McAllen, Texas.  It's a disgrace. This bill provides the FBI with $375 million for a new headquarters and over $11 billion in funding.  I guess the Democrats don't care about the collusion between Big Tech, the FBI, and the Intelligence Community as we've learned from the Twitter Files. This bill funds wokeness: - $8.6 mil for “gender advisor programs” at Pentagon - $200 mil for a Gender Equity Fund &amp; gender programs in Pakistan - $575 mil for "family planning" where population growth "threatens biodiversity"    Woke handouts should NOT be funded by taxpayers. During the last year, Democrats controlled the House, Senate, &amp; presidency, yet they failed to do their most basic task.  Senate Dems passed ZERO appropriations bills out of their committee. Senate Dems passed ZERO appropriations bills off the floor.  They didn't do a damn thing. A new direction is coming. In 11 days, Republicans will deliver it.</em>”</p>

Why? Because if Americans had time to learn what's in the bill, they would be appalled. So here are a few “highlights” ⤵️ The bill directs hundreds of millions of dollars to migrant shelter services and NGOs that facilitate illegal immigration, and further incentivizes unlawful crossings by providing $10 million for legal assistance for detained migrants. The omnibus bill also hands the IRS  over $12 billion — on top of the $80 billion they received from the Inflation Reduction Act — and even authorizes a chauffeur for the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. The IRS head gets a driver, you get an audit. The omnibus package also includes a $65 million increase in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, an organization that has used anti-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Semitic</span> and pro-terrorist material to educate children. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but gives you insight into why these provisions are not unveiled until the last minute. Without the pretext of a funding emergency— one self-manufactured by Congress — supporters would not be able to justify voting for this 4,155 page bill.</em>”</p>
