I wouldn't demand it to be mandatory"  We all saw how that turned out  <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/video-shows-president-elect-biden-110845265.html">Link to news.yahoo.com</a> Going back to COVID response, we're also being sold a load of garbage over Biden's vaccine mandate:  To begin, while this mandate makes no consideration for natural immunity, a recent CDC admission points how effective it actually is vs a vaccine:  <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://t.co/hF28b8Z5GU">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">In response to attorney‚Äôs FOIA request, US CDC admits that it has no record of an unvaccinated person spreading COVID after recovering from COVID.  Lawyers smelling blood in the water. https://t.co/ajdOuiIyjj</span></a> Case in point, first we were told: "You‚Äôre not going to ‚Äî you‚Äôre not going to get COVID if you have these vaccinations."  Now we‚Äôre being told that people have to get vaccinated to protect the already-vaccinated.  <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/07/22/remarks-by-president-biden-in-a-cnn-town-hall-with-don-lemon/">Link to www.whitehouse.gov</a> And yet, while there's a new push to vaccinate 5-11 year old kids (including Big Bird), there's very little discussion on the myocarditis risks.  <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://t.co/c6pysGHIDS">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">It's reasonable for a parent to want to see more data. To date, there is zero data (appropriately powered) to make any statements about the risk of myocarditis/myocarditis death in children 5-11. My deep dive into the Pfizer vax study with @NBSaphierMD https://t.co/F59MPEXzzE</span></a> Then there was the massive whirlwind of lies about Ivermectin not being meant for human consumption. Never mind that it received a nobel prize in 2015 for its applications in treating human disease.  <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2015/press-release/">Link to www.nobelprize.org</a> Next, gain of function Fauci called Senator Paul a liar and said that they NIH did not fund dangerous gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Lab:   We now know that to be false. <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/nih-admits-funding-gain-function-125103852.html">Link to www.yahoo.com</a> But that's not all of the good doctor's dishonesty.  Here's a reminder on how Fauci went back and forth on masks, changing his advice to fit the political narrative of the moment.  This is CLEARLY not about science or your health. It's about compliance.  <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://t.co/noBS84yfma">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">Holy shit this is beyond a must watch. Fauci is the biggest spreader of Covid misinformation in America. https://t.co/hWPZw8xGIM</span></a> Next, the border: When questioned about whether he was planning on allocating 450k to individual illegal immigrants, Biden said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not going to happen.‚Äù   His handlers at the White House quickly clarified.   <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/11/03/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-authorization-of-the-covid-19-vaccine-for-children-ages-5-to-11/">Link to www.whitehouse.gov</a> The next day, the WH Dep. Sec. said, ‚ÄúThe President is perfectly comfortable with the Department of Justice settling with the individuals and families who are currently in litigation with the U.S. government."   <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/06/politics/biden-immigrants-payments-zero-tolerance/index.html">Link to www.cnn.com</a> And speaking of the border, let's not forget when when the White House was outright denying the existence of a border crisis, despite all obvious evidence to the contrary:  <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/video/white-house-press-secretary-crisis-border-76614562">Link to abcnews.go.com</a> But once that lie gave out, "Border Czar" Harris didn‚Äôt actually visit the border   Instead of going to the heart of the crisis, she flew into El Paso, took her pictures, and did nothing to address the cartel driven border that is worsening every day  <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/06/25/kamala-harris-doesnt-actually-visit-border-says-nothing-of-substance-leaves/">Link to nypost.com</a> Then there were those midnight flights from the border, which Psaki tried to mislead America about  When asked by P. Doocy about flying UAC‚Äôs in the middle of the night (2:30 AM &amp; 4:29AM), she said, ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôm not sure that it‚Äôs the middle of the night.‚Äù  <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/psaki-denies-transporting-illegal-immigrants-194026775.html">Link to www.yahoo.com</a> And then there was the smear about Border Patrol Agents "whipping" migrants (which never happened).   Biden STILL hasn't apologized for this lie:  <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biden-border-agents-apology">Link to www.foxnews.com</a> The admin lied about how many Americans were left in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> and lied about staying until every American was out of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>.  <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/18/biden-says-us-will-stay-in-afghanistan-until-all-americans-allies-who-want-to-leave-can-do-so-506112">Link to www.politico.com</a> During the Virginia election we were told over and over again how Critical Race Theory supposedly wasn‚Äôt being taught in the state‚Äôs public schools. In reality, it was woven into the fabric of the curricula   <a href="https://townhall.com/columnists/larryoconnor/2021/11/09/crt-isnt-in-the-curriculum-its-the-language-of-the-curriculum-n2598803">Link to townhall.com</a> Biden claimed he would not raise taxes if your income was under $400K  Biden‚Äôs Build Back Better agenda would ‚Äúraise taxes on up to 30 percent of middle-class families"  <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/12/bidens-build-back-better-will-raise-taxes-on-30-of-middle-class-families/">Link to nypost.com</a> Plus, inflation is a tax on all consumers. Yet Biden‚Äôs claims that inflation is ‚Äútemporary‚Äù has predictably proven to be complete garbage as prices continue to spike to their highest level in 30 years.  <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/13/yet-another-biden-claim-that-inflation-is-temporary-proves-wrong/">Link to nypost.com</a> Bottom line:  All this is just a sampling from Biden‚Äôs first 10 months in office. We‚Äôll continue to update this as needed.   There's sure to be no shortage of Biden lies and misinfo going forward.</em>‚Äù</p>
