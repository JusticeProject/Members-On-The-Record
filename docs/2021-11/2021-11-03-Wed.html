"In [the op-ed], we outlined steps the Biden Admin needed to take to mitigate the fallout that was certain to happen with our withdrawal. Instead, the White House &amp; the @StateDept spent months kicking the can down the road, doing little to adequately prepare for our withdrawal. "As a result of the Biden Administration‚Äôs lack of preparation, we watched horrific scenes unfold as the Taliban quickly took over the country: A sea of humanity, desperately trying to make it through the airport gates that represented freedom. "Mothers handing their children over the walls of HKIA to strangers ‚Äì willingly giving them up in the hopes of saving their lives. Four busloads of university women, who had visas and a plane ready to take them to Portugal, being refused entry to the airport. "Desperate Afghans, clinging to planes as they take off, while the world in horror as some fell from the sky. And, after the blasts at Abbey Gate, blood and bodies and hundreds of grieving families. "This has been a stunning failure of leadership. And it‚Äôs been an abdication of the most basic duties of the US government: To protect Americans and leave no one behind. In the midst of this chaos, the @StateDept has been all but useless to those who were trying to escape. "Thankfully, outside organizations ‚Äì patriots as far as I‚Äôm concerned ‚Äì stepped up to fill the vacuum. Primarily organized by veterans, groups like @TForcePineapple, Argo, AWS, Dynamo and @AlliedAirlift21 have saved thousands of lives. And they are continuing to save lives today. "Yet, @StateDept leaders have provided little clarity on how they‚Äôve been coordinating with these groups, which they've promised to do. Some light has been shed very recently. But per my conversations w/various groups, the coordination has been &amp; remains extremely inconsistent. "In the wake of this unmitigated disaster created by @POTUS @JoeBiden, reports coming out of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> are appalling: 85% of SIV applicants ‚Äì heroes who risked their lives to help our special operators ‚Äì were left behind enemy lines to be hunted and slaughtered by the Taliban. "Reports that little girls as young as 9 years old are being sold off to marry 55-year-old warlords just so their families can eat. People are being terrorized. They are rounded up by the Taliban, threatened, and in some instances, beaten or worse. "And all the while, we still can‚Äôt get a straight answer from the State Department on how many American citizens were abandoned. Or how many are still there, desperately trying to flee the terrorists who now control the country. "Mr. Deputy Secretary, enough is enough. We are all tired of getting half answers &amp; form letters from your Dept. We are tired of finding out more information from the news than through official channels. And I am personally tired of the lying and the spin and the stonewalling. "You have an opportunity today to help repair the significant damage done to this committee‚Äôs relationship with the Biden Administration.
