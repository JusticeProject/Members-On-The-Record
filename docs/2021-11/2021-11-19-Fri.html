David, you could put on George Harrison's 1970 triple album masterpiece All Things Must Pass, listen to it all the way through, and then listen to George's underrated follow-up Living In The Material World, and this speech would still be longer. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://t.co/xE3SvuGNou">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">I hoping it's less than "All Things Must Pass." #KevinGoneWild https://t.co/t0OeQlAgvG</span></a> Everyone, I'm sorry, the music comparisons are getting pretty tough at this point.

At 195 minutes, Kevin McCarthy's speech is longer than The Right Stuff, a 1983 film that tells the story of the Mercury Seven, the beginnings of NASA, and the early years of the Space Race. A pretty good movie. At 230 minutes, Kevin McCarthy's speech is now longer than David Lean's sweeping 1962 epic Lawrence of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Arabia</span> At over 252 minutes, Kevin McCarthy's speech is now longer than the Extended Editions of all three films in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy Ok one more musical one for those of you who are still up, at 306 minutes, this pack of rambling lies that we'll charitably call a "speech" is now longer than Neil Young's entire solo studio discography from the 1970's, After The Gold Rush through Rust Never Sleeps. Thanks for following, hope you all enjoyed this. In the end McCarthy's speech was longer than David Bowie's entire 1970's studio output, and longer than every REM studio album with the band's original lineup put together.
