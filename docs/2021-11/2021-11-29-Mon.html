If Democrats move against @laurenboebert, who apologized, they'll only help Lauren and reveal their true nature.  @IlhanMN committed immigration fraud by repulsively marrying her brother, revers Al-Qaeda, &amp; refers to 9/11 Islamic terror attack as ‚Äòsome people did something.' 2. @SpeakerPelosi has already proven that she uses her position of power to attack her enemies.   The Russian collusion investigation led by top liar @RepAdamSchiff has already been proven to be the real #BigLie, but Nancy won't apologize for wasting the People's time &amp; money. 3. Instead, Pelosi is on her last destroy America stint in power, she's still abusing her Speakership with another fake committee just to spread more propaganda &amp; lies against Republicans about J6.  And it's laughable Schiff is on that witch hunt too.  The Committee of Clowns. 4. Pelosi's defense of @ericswalwell is the one that should cause every single American serious concern.  Swalwell was so dumb that he was easily enticed into a sexual relationship with a Communist Chinese spy.  Shamefully, Pelosi protects his seat on the Intelligence Committee. 5. Well you know how Democrats are. They are #AmericaLast and #ChinaFirst and Hunter Biden has proven that all too well in his business dealings.  Pelosi probably told Swalwell to take Hunter's racist advice &amp; be careful who he sleeps with to protect our country's secrets. <a href="https://twitter.com/mtgreenee/status/1465322032846016523/photo/1">Link to image</a> 6.
