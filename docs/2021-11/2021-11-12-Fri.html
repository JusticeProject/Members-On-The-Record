Any global, or domestic commitment to reduce GHGs lacks teeth without a robust Article 6 rulebook.  (For those who want less jargon, a brief thread): <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://t.co/l26qlwOyQO">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">2/ Article 6 is the #ParisAgreement‚Äôs engine of international cooperation. Good to see Parties at #COP26 making progress on guidance.  AND: We must ensure that markets have high integrity. That means corresponding adjustments for 6.4ERs, and no (or sharply limited) pre-2020 CERs.</span></a> 1/ Here's @EnvDefenseFund with a primer on Article 6.  <a href="https://www.edf.org/climate/implementing-paris-climate-agreement">Link to www.edf.org</a> 2/ At core, A6 is about transparency and accounting.  Transparency being the thing that allows any country that pledges to cut their emissions from X to Y tons/yr to have open records so that any other country can audit their sources and sinks and verify the number. 3/ Accounting is how to deal with cross-border flows.  If I make wind power and sell the electricity to a steel mill, which of us gets credit for the CO2 reduction?  You can make a case for either one - but you can't make the case for both without double counting reductions 4/ The US has consistently been on the right side of both issues. But for obvious reasons relating to forms of government and concentration of certain industries, it's been very hard to reach political consensus. 5/ For example, if you're a country with a lot of forest, you'd like credits for CO2 reduction from forest preservation.  But if you're a country who's economy depends on burning fossil fuel, you'd like to be able to buy absolution by paying for forest preservation 6/ There is no right answer to this question other than the development of a consistent rule book. Once that's in place, we can be confident that the sum of all countries GHG reduction pledges are additive.  Without it, the whole system falls apart.  That's the crux of Article 6. 7/ One of the advantages the Americans have in this negotiation FWIW is that we have to deal with all those same issues domestically.  The economic self interest of Russia/<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>/other FF-intensive countries are closely matched by those of WV/TX/other FF-intensive states 8/ We of course also have states with huge forests that we'd like to preserve, and states that should be net exporters of wind/solar/geothermal that have interests similar to those of places like Brazil (forest-intensive) or Nordic countries with a glut of offshore wind 9/ The Climate Risk Disclosure Act that we worked on with @ewarren is, in part Article 6 for our domestic economy, and ultimately will need to be synchronized with international rules, just as all accounting standards do.  <a href="https://casten.house.gov/media/press-releases/casten-warren-climate-risk-disclosure-act-passes-house-financial-services-0">Link to casten.house.gov</a> 10/ I leave you with the wisdom of a former colleague from my private sector life: "no one would bowl if you didn't keep score".  Article 6 is how we keep score.  Watch this space.  /fin</em>‚Äù</p>

They risked their own lives to bring my body back to my family.  From the moment I woke up in Walter Reed 11 days later, I vowed to find a way to repay them as well as all those who sacrifice so much for our nation. So while I can‚Äôt fly combat missions anymore or help drag Soldiers from a burning Blackhawk if the worst should strike again, I can use my current role‚Äîserving no longer from the cockpit but the Senate‚Äîto ensure our Armed Forces are the strongest they can be. Because to me, true patriotism will always be how we honor the sacrifices those in uniform have made for the rest of us. Not just on Veterans Day, but every other day of the year, too.</em>‚Äù</p>

It‚Äôs a story of humility, and one of the most important lessons that I‚Äôve learned.   Thread üëá <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://t.co/yIxDvAEcAz">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">This past weekend, I told a story from my time in the Marines at our Milford Veterans Town Hall. https://t.co/UMmWTRHDAp</span></a> I graduated infantry in 2011 at 23 years old. Boy, was I confident.   I knew the tactics. I did well in training. And upon deployment to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>, I thought I had it figured out. Right before we left, our Battalion Commander made a decision that we were going to switch out the vehicles that we were using, from light armored vehicles to IED resistant vehicles.  This came at a cost. It hindered our mobility, maintenance, and firepower. 23-year-old Second Lieutenant Auchincloss thought that this Lieutenant Colonel did not know what he was doing. I thought it was going to hinder our offensive capabilities and really undermine our training.   I believed this decision was a mistake. I commanded a forward patrol base. We were going out on daily patrols of Taliban-influenced villages. One day, there was a gunfight down at Helmand River and we were the closest platoon.   I directed the platoon in single file down a narrow dirt road to the village. Immediately, I thought something wasn‚Äôt right. This is exactly what the Taliban wanted us to be doing. We needed to rethink this.   BOOM! An IED struck our lead vehicle. I‚Äôll never forget that feeling; I can see it in my consciousness now. I could picture the driver of the lead vehicle. Lance Corporal. 19 years old. It was like every drop of blood was out of my body. I may have thought we sacrificed training, but my Marines showed me otherwise.  I didn‚Äôt even have to give an order. They were sweeping. They were providing cover. They were evacuating the Marines.  And there were about 45 seconds of radio silence. Then it came through from my Platoon Sergeant who had been in the lead vehicle -- no casualties.   And second only to the birth of my children, it was the best feeling in the world. That Lance Corporal is alive today because my Battalion Commander made a good decision.  And Second Lieutenant Auchincloss thought that he was wiser.  I think about that often. I try to embed that humility into how I approach questions big and small. None of us have it all figured out. I don‚Äôt care how smart you think you are or what position you hold -- listen to the wisdom of others.   Be thankful that the worst-case scenario can be avoided by listening to someone wiser than you.</em>‚Äù</p>
