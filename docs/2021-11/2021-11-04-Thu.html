We also have an obligation to protect US citizens. The catastrophic withdrawal from <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> made it clear that we must have independent oversight of the screening &amp; vetting of evacuees. In the 2 months since the evacuation, we have confirmed through congressional oversight &amp; a briefing from fed officials that most of the evacuees didn't receive the standard vetting interviews &amp; that individuals that pose natl security threats made it to our shores. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm pleased #HSGAC adopted my amendment to the Inspector General Independence and Empowerment Act to ensure that appropriate IG oversight is carried out regarding the vetting &amp; processing of the Afghan evacuees prior to their resettlement into our communities.</em>‚Äù</p>
