Reports indicate that the Justice Department has been considering payouts to illegal immigrants of $450k per person, which is more than four times what the government pays the families of fallen troops when they lose a loved one. This is unacceptable. The American people deserve greater oversight to ensure their hard-earned money isn’t going towards open border policies. Today, I introduced Judgment Fund Accountability Act. This bill calls for an increase in transparency and oversight of the @USTreasury’s Judgment Fund. It would also bar the Treasury Dept. from using the Judgment Fund to provide payments to illegal immigrants. This bill is an update to my Judgement Fund Transparency Act from 2013. I have long been concerned about how the fund is often abused, like in 2016 when the Obama admin used it to transfer $1.3 billion to the Islamic Republic of <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>.

Meanwhile, in the three months since the Armed Services Committee passed this bill, the threats we face around the world — China and Russia, North Korea and <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>, terrorist organizations in Afghanistan — have only gotten worse. Considering #FY22NDAA on the Senate floor is a crucial step in the process - it allows all senators a chance to make their marks through the amendment process. Instead, we have wasted months of floor time waiting for an unpopular, partisan bill that hadn’t even been written yet. This additional delay will make getting our job done – and doing it right – that much harder. Now, @SenSchumer has almost guaranteed this year will be one of the latest starts to the bicameral conference process ever.
