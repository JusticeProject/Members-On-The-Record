He was a West Point grad who served four combat tours in Afghanistan and <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span>, and a deeply moral person who called out and helped end the torture of detainees in those wars.  His death is heartbreaking, and should be a call to action. 1/ <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://t.co/uS1a0G2Slt">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">Ian Fishback was found dead the morning of Nov 19th, 2021 of an apparent suicide.</span></a> I met Ian in 2005, when I worked at Human Rights Watch. He came to us to report detainee abuse at a forward operating base in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span>. His account was significant because it proved that the abuses at Abu Ghraib were systemic, not isolated incidents. 2/ <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/28/world/middleeast/officer-criticizes-detainee-abuse-inquiry.html">Link to www.nytimes.com</a> I encouraged Ian to reach out to John McCain, and eventually took him to meet the Senator. In a letter to McCain, Ian said "I would rather die fighting than give up even the smallest part of the idea that is America." 3/ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/27/AR2005092701527.html">Link to www.washingtonpost.com</a> Ian's testimony helped spur Congress to pass the Detainee Treatment Act, which ended the Bush administration's torture policies, and, in Ian's words, gave our troops "clear standards of conduct that reflect the ideals they risk their lives for." 4/ <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1975813_1975847_1976748,00.html">Link to content.time.com</a> Ian left the army with the rank of Major, taught at West Point, even thought about running for office someday. But for whatever reason, his troubles, including with mental health, grew in recent years. 5/ A few days ago, a mutual friend told me that Ian was in serious trouble. I saw reports he'd been in a homeless shelter, and reached out to the VA to see if he could get better care. But obviously too late. 6/ I don't know if more could have been done, but I will get answers. Meanwhile we know this: when we almost ran out of ICU beds during COVID, it was a scandal. Yet year after year, we tolerate long waiting lists for people who need mental health treatment.7/ <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/understaffed-state-psychiatric-facilities-leave-mental-health-patients-limbo-n1282196">Link to www.nbcnews.com</a> We have to do better, especially for veterans like Ian Fishback who gave everything to protect our country, and to make our country better. 8/</em>‚Äù</p>
