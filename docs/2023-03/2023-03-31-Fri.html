Let's dispel some myths: MYTH: This bill allows unlimited surveillance by the U.S. government! Fact: Totally untrue. This bill doesn't give the government any power to track what you're searching! In fact, it is aimed at COUNTERING foreign surveillance from authoritarian nations. The bill is restricted to tech from just a handful of nations ‚Äì China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, and <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span> ‚Äì that are controlled by authoritarian regimes. MYTH: The RESTRICT Act unfairly targets TikTok! Fact: It would be unconstitutional to ban a specific company just because lawmakers feel like it. The RESTRICT Act is a framework to identify and study ALL foreign tech threats where a serious national security risk is presented. A ban is on the table if ‚Äì and only if ‚Äì foreign companies pose a serious threat to our national security. The bill also allows for less drastic remedies if a full ban isn't required ‚Äì think privacy or corporate transparency requirements. The RESTRICT Act also prioritizes being candid about these threats with Americans. It requires information about threats to be declassified and shared widely ‚Äì so nothing is being banned or mitigated without clear, transparent reasoning. MYTH: The RESTRICT Act is anti-China xenophobia! Fact: The RESTRICT Act is aimed at a range of AUTHORITARIAN nations ‚Äì not just China. We need to be clear: our problem is NOT with the Chinese people or Chinese Americans ‚Äì it's with the Chinese Communist Party and Xi Jinping. The issue here is that under authoritarian regimes, businesses like TikTok can be FORCED to do the bidding of state intelligence services. While U.S. social media companies need reform, we don't require that companies turn over any and all data whenever the government wants. In America, private companies can ‚Äì and often do ‚Äì contest government requests for user data. We've got laws on the books and a whole legal system designed to prevent abuses. They're imperfect, but we can have a transparent debate about this stuff. That's not true in China. A number of Chinese laws require any company under the PRC's jurisdiction to assist security services ‚Äì whether that's censoring content, sharing private data, or assisting with cyber or transnational repression campaigns against dissidents. I have been incredibly vocal in criticizing U.S. tech companies over the years, and I have written bills that would reign in their bad practices. We absolutely need comprehensive privacy laws in the U.S., and I'll continue to push for those, too. MYTH: The RESTRICT Act criminalizes what you can say online. Fact: The RESTRICT Act is focused on foreign corporations, not on users. The 1st Amendment protects Americans' right to share and receive information ‚Äì and this bill doesn't alter that. The RESTRICT Act builds on a process ‚Äì created under President Trump and supported by President Biden ‚Äì that would allow the Secretary of Commerce to review certain transactions. What kind of transactions‚Ä¶? The government is only able to review ‚Äúcovered transactions,‚Äù which means transactions involving a foreign adversary (China, Russia, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iran</span>) or an entity based in those countries. But it's actually even more specific than that. The RESTRICT Act only has the power to mitigate extremely high risk actions ‚Äì like sabotaging U.S. tech, catastrophically impacting infrastructure, or interfering in our federal elections. Let me say it again: there are NO criminal penalties in this bill for your free speech ‚Äì you're even free to drag the RESTRICT Act if you want! I stand firmly with freedom of speech, and my bill doesn't affect or influence what Americans can say in any way, shape or form. This bill takes on big, systemic threats to our national security ‚Äì not individual users. MYTH: Senators don't understand that people make their living on TikTok! Fact: I think there's a lot of creativity happening on TikTok! I know influencers &amp; other Americans rely on it. I'm also a former tech entrepreneur, and I wholeheartedly believe in the free marketplace. But there's a reason we're all not on MySpace anymore ‚Äì the internet adapts. I have total confidence that there will be apps out there that can facilitate the same communications as TikTok, without being beholden to an authoritarian, communist regime that endangers our security. I also want to point out this legislation really isn't unusual or overreaching on the global stage ‚Äì plenty of countries have taken even more direct action against TikTok specifically. TikTok is outright banned in India. It's banned on government devices in Canada, the EU, the UK, Norway, New Zealand, and Belgium. We're likely to see more countries follow suit soon. Folks, I'm glad to engage in discussion about this bill and hear critiques. This bill is about protecting YOUR privacy from authoritarian nations and protecting Americans from foreign coercion. I'm proud of the bipartisan coalition we've built to get it done.</em>‚Äù</p>
