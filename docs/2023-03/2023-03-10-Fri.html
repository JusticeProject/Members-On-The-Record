I voted NO. As a 40 year-educator at @BennettCollege, an #HBCU for women, I can tell you two of the keys to a good education are knowledge and understanding. These values are anathema to demagogues and people using hate to divide us.

While there are countless people at TSA who sincerely try to make the airport experience as easy as possible, there are also many who don't, and seem determined to achieve the opposite outcome. 4. While third-party passenger-screening companies undoubtedly have some rude and otherwise unhelpful people on their payrolls, it's infinitely easier for a private company to fire bad workers than it is for the federal government. 5. By the same token, airports that receive complaints about their private security screeners could always hire another company. 6. Although any airport could use qualified, non-TSA screeners, the federal government makes it needlessly difficult to do so, effectively perpetuating the virtual monopoly TSA has in the airport passenger-screening industry. 7.
