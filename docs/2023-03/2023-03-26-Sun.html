(Link to twitter.com)</span></a> Today, I am proud to endorse &amp; serve as a campaign co-chair for @BarbaraLeeForCA. We need a strong anti-war voice in the Senate. Barbara Lee's lone vote against the AUMF giving a blank check for an endless war in Afghanistan is one of the most courageous acts of modern times, as was her opposition to the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> War. It inspired me to run for Congress at age 27 on an anti-<span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> war platform. It takes a special person, a true leader, to stand up for what is right when every single one of your colleagues in Congress is sitting down. That is who Barbara Lee is. We need leaders like that in the Senate.  <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/antiwar-primary-challenge/">Antiwar Primary Challenge... | thenation.com</a> She knew that opposing the Bush administration‘s endless wars in Afghanistan and <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Iraq</span> would come at a cost. It did. She was vilified. She faced death threats. But in the end, she was vindicated. Barbara Lee's stand was not just symbolism. The AUMF she opposed granted sweeping powers to the executive branch to wage war, usurping the role of Congress delineated in the Constitution. These powers have been abused by multiple presidents. In the event of future calls for military action, or equally ill-considered domestic policies, we need voices in the Senate to urge restraint. Barbara Lee will be that voice. She has been for her whole career. She worked with me on passing the Yemen WPR. Her domestic policy record is equally laudable. Having been a young, single mother, Barbara understands the importance of protecting critical programs like SNAP and the child tax credit. She has been a champion for them in Congress as chair of the task force on poverty, income inequality and opportunity. If we want to become a truly multiracial, multiethnic democracy, representation is essential. Black women are the heart and soul of the Democratic Party, yet there is not one Black woman serving in the Senate. There is no one better to fill this void than @BarbaraLeeForCA.</em>”</p>
