[There] were.” “Multiple people in the Biden administration said they had planned for every contingency. They did not. Instead, they spent the next four months kicking the can down the road.” “As a result, when the Taliban rapidly captured territory during the summer of 2021 and entered Kabul on August 15th – we simply weren't ready.” "Because of the Biden administration's dereliction of duty, the world watched heartbreaking scenes unfold in &amp; around the Kabul airport for the next two weeks. A sea of humanity, desperately trying to make it through airport gates that represented freedom." “Desperate Afghans, clinging to planes as they took off – with some plummeting from the sky to their deaths. Mothers handing their children to strangers over the airport walls – willingly giving them up in the hopes of saving their lives." “And then, horror struck on August 26th. A suicide bomber at Abbey Gate killed 13 American servicemembers, injured at least 45 more, and killed approximately 170 Afghans. That day was the deadliest day for American troops in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> in 10 years." “We are joined today by Marine Sergeant Tyler Vargas-Andrews and former Army Specialist Aidan Gunderson. Both were deployed to <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> during the evacuation. They can give a first-hand account of what it was like inside the Kabul airport during those harrowing two weeks.” “In the midst of the unfolding chaos in Kabul in August 2021, the U.S. State Department was all but useless.” “Thankfully – in the void left by an absent State Department – many Americans stepped up to fill the vacuum. Primarily organized by veterans, groups like Allied Airlift 21, Team America, and Task Force Pineapple – just to name a few – saved thousands of lives.” “What happened in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> was a systemic breakdown of the federal government at every level – and a stunning failure of leadership by the Biden administration.” “Because even though President Biden said, and I quote, ‘if there's American citizens left, we're gonna stay to get them all out.' – we now know he left more than 1,000 American citizens in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>.” “I want every gold and blue star family member, and every veteran out there watching this to know: I will not rest until we determine how this happened – and hold those responsible for it accountable.”</em>”</p>
