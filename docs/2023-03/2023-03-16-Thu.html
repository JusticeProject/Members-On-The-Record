Russia intentionally knocked down a U.S. drone operating legally in international airspace.    Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump, and other strong leaders would not take crap like this from adversaries of the United States. I hope the Pentagon sends drones back in the same airspace and lets Russia know that we will defend American assets.   Big wars start when brutal aggression is met with weakness.   The best way to prevent big wars is to quickly stand up to aggressors. What will lead to a wider war would be to allow Putin to succeed in Ukraine - enticing him to take other territory in Europe - which he claims belongs to Russia.   That would lead to an Article 5 NATO violation and American troops would immediately be put in harm's way. In other cases, allowing Iran to continue enriching uranium, ultimately reaching weapons-grade level, will force <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> to eventually act.   Weakness against Putin will surely lead to China's invasion of Taiwan. History has shown weakness in the face of aggression and only leads to wider conflict.</em>”</p>

The DEA estimates that 90% of all of the illegal drugs in the United States enter through our southern border, which has been responsible for killing over 100,000 Americans in 2022 alone. Under President Biden, America has lost more people to drug overdoses than Americans who perished during WWI. The number of deadly drug overdoses recorded under President Biden triples the number of Americans who died during the Vietnam war. Action must also be taken to prevent more drugs from entering the country, and the best way to do this is by strengthening our southern border with Mexico. In addition to preventing the flow of drugs across the border, efforts must be made to eliminate the Mexican drug cartels operating within the country. Federal agencies, working in conjunction with state and local law enforcement, need to launch a comprehensive program to identify, sanction, and dismantle the cartels operating in our neighborhoods. If we don't eliminate this threat, we stand to lose a generation of Americans to drug overdoses and cartel violence.  If we don't act now, we risk never regaining the sovereignty of our nation again.</em>”</p>
