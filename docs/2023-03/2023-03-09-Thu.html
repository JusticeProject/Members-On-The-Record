The several recent attacks against <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>i citizens, and the targeting of the Palestinian village of Huwara by settler extremists, are deplorable. <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> remains a critical democratic ally of the US, and a peaceful resolution to the ongoing tensions through a two-state solution remains my priority. I support the February 26, 2023, Joint Communique in Aqaba, Jordan, between <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span> and the Palestinians to deescalate tensions. I share the Biden Administration's concerns about several controversial proposals being discussed in the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>i Knesset with regard to judicial reform. I understand that <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>'s elected leaders need to make their own decisions and are engaged in a contentious debate. I hope all parties come together to reach a reasonable and balanced agreement that would maintain the core democratic values shared by our two countries. In this fragile moment, sustained U.S. diplomatic leadership is critical to prevent further violent escalations.

It keeps me up at night knowing our enemies may no longer fear us and our allies no longer trust us. Withdrawing our limited forces from <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span> will not only further weaken our national security and that of our allies, but also cede a dangerous amount of power in the region to Iran and Russia. It is strategically important for the United States to maintain a strong foothold in the region. While ISIS no longer controls significant territory in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span>, thousands of ISIS terrorist fighters remain in the area, ready, willing, and able to do harm to America and our allies. We cannot neutralize this threat from a position of weakness. The United States does not bow to the will of terrorists.

We're still on track to spend more than we bring in by over $1 trillion this year, just like last year. 2/4 In Biden's first year in office, he spent $2.7 trillion more than we took in.

Five of the were just 20 years old. My eldest son, who wanted to be a marine like me, was the exact same age at the time. I am an Emergency Room doctor who is used to seeing people die, both here in the United States and as the head of our Emergency Room in Kandahar.  I am accustomed to controlling my emotions in stressful situations.    But on August 26th, 2021, I lost my composure. The chaos of our exit, qnd the lack of support for our men and women in uniform, despite their excellent performance, was offensive to my sense of justice and loyalty.   I have lost friends over there. I think of them daily. That single day in August, we lost more American lives than my entire time in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span>.  When I was serving as a Chief Surgeon, Kabul was safer than Chicago.  Women and girls had more freedom in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> than they do today. But then we abandoned our position. We handed the Taliban with billions of dollars' worth of equipment, supplies, and arms. But today we have had amazing testimony of heroism and duty from patriots who saved as many lives as they were able.   It is time that America heard THEIR stories.   It is time America heard the truth. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republicans-hearing-botched-afghanistan-withdrawal-biden-rcna73009">House GOP kicks off its first hearing on the botched <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghanistan</span> withdrawal... | nbcnews.com</a></em>‚Äù</p>

At Large for Global Women's Issues on #IWD2023. GOP obstruction blocked her nom for *months* due to Rs' obsession over women's repro health ‚Äì which is not under the jurisdiction of this role. Let me spell this out: This is one of the few roles in our diplomatic tool box to address gender issues, especially in precarious environments, such as supporting <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Afghan</span> women risking their lives to uphold basic human rights. GOP obstruction has delayed us from using this role to support those women. Barriers facing women in accessing school, capital, employment &amp; more are all areas this role can address. Yet, GOP obstruction due to the nominee's personal views that have no jurisdiction over the role stagnated U.S. action in this capacity. That's shameful and it has to stop. U.S. diplomacy should never suffer so a party can score political points. Senators are here to cast votes &amp; make policy ‚Äì certain lawmakers have prevented us from doing that. I urge them to take this responsibility seriously and allow the Senate to do its job. And to that end, I urge swift floor consideration for Dr. Gupta ‚Äì this role has been vacant long enough.</em>‚Äù</p>
