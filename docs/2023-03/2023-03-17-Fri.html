Just how bad is it? üßµ‚§µÔ∏è <a href="https://twitter.com/RepWPH/status/1636413968079110154/photo/1">Link to image</a> The DEA estimates that 90% of all of the illegal drugs in the United States enter through our southern border, which has been responsible for killing over 100,000 Americans in 2022 alone. Under President Biden, America has lost more people to drug overdoses than Americans who perished during WWI. The number of deadly drug overdoses recorded under President Biden triples the number of Americans who died during the Vietnam War. Major Cartels operating within the United States include: Sinaloa, Gulf, Ju√°rez, Knights Templar, Los Zetas. 1. Sinaloa Cartel: This is one of the most powerful and influential drug trafficking organizations in the world. The cartel is known for its sophisticated smuggling techniques and its ruthless violence. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-40480405">Mexico cartels: Which are the biggest and most powerful?... | bbc.com</a> Gulf Cartel: another major drug trafficking organization that operates primarily out of Mexico. The cartel has been involved in human trafficking, kidnapping, and extortion.  Recently, they were responsible for kidnapping four Americans and killing two. <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/kidnapping-4-americans-mexico/story?id=97706114">Everything we know about the kidnapping of 4 Americans in Mexico... | abcnews.go.com</a> Ju√°rez Cartel: This cartel operates primarily in Ciudad Ju√°rez, a border city in Mexico, but its activities also extend into the United States. They're known for extreme violence, including the use of decapitation and other gruesome tactics. <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/mexican-cartel-ordered-pay-over-4b-2019-deaths-9-american-women-kids-young-infants">Mexican Juarez cartel ordered to pay over $4B for 2019 deaths of 9 American women, kids as young as infants... | foxnews.com</a> Knights Templar Cartel: This is a relatively new drug cartel that operates in Mexico but has also been involved in drug trafficking in the United States. The Knights Templar Cartel is known for its ruthless tactics that include executing police officers. <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2011/7/22/the-knights-templar-mexicos-newest-drug-cartel">‚ÄòThe Knights Templar': Mexico's newest drug cartel... | <span class="MOTR_Keyword">aljazeera</span>.com</a> Los Zetas Cartel: another powerful and dangerous drug cartel that is known for its brutal tactics.

If we don't eliminate this threat, we stand to lose a generation of Americans to drug overdoses and cartel violence.  If we don't act now, we risk never regaining the sovereignty of our nation again.</em>‚Äù</p>
