At least 270,000 Iraqis and 4,600 U.S. service members killed. An estimated $2 trillion spent on what is known as the biggest foreign policy catastrophe of our time.  Today, that authorization is still on the books. It's been used by both Democratic and Republican Presidents to justify military actions (that we know of) in Iraq and <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span>, and against Iran. Keeping this authorization in place is a liability, and undercuts Congress' constitutional duty to declare war. That's why I voted to repeal the 2002 AUMF last term – especially because I was in middle school when Congress passed it and my generation and San Diego's military community have borne incredible costs from this war. I'm glad the Senate is making progress to repeal it too. We can't forget the devastating toll of this war on the Iraqi people – all the lives lost, wounded, and forever changed. We still have work ahead to fully address and make amends for the civilian harm that we caused.</em>”</p>
