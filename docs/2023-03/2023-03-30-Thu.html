I've been working on this for a long time, along with some great people like @TimKaine and @RepBarbaraLee.   A short wonky 🧵on AUMFs and Congress: Only Congress has the Constitutional authority to declare war. For too long, we've abdicated that power and responsibility.  Allowing presidents of both parties to use laws to justify military action in countries or against adversaries not even named in an authorization must end. I've worked with colleagues to repeal the 2002 AUMF against Iraq for many years, over the objection of multiple presidents.   By its very terms, the authorization has no application and hasn't for a long time. Congress has just lacked the courage to act. And when presidents sought to extend a previous war power to cover a new field of battle or new adversary — like in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Syria</span> or Libya — not even debated by Congress, we've stood up: <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1641154257314357251/photo/1">Link to image</a> I'm glad the Senate took action on the 2002 Iraq AUMF.  But it's also time for us to take a hard look at the 2001 Al Qaeda AUMF.   I've tried time and again to have it revised or repealed. Because a 60-word resolution is not a legal justification for endless war. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/1641154259310788626/photo/1">Link to image</a> So where do we go from here?  First, the House must swiftly take up the Senate-passed bill.  Second, we need the White House to work with us on repealing the 2001 AUMF.  Finally, we need to aggressively reassert Congress' war powers. To end these forever wars, once and forever.</em>”</p>
