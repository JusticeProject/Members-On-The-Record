Some thoughts:  1/ <a href="https://twitter.com/RepJasonCrow/status/1637485691121684480/photo/1">Link to image</a> We didn't know what would happen, but we had each other; I often think of those men. It's said that you see the best and the worst of humanity in war. Sheer brutality, but also acts of selfless-service and courage. It's true. 2/ Now, as a Congressman with responsibility to debate and decide matters of war and peace, I view my role through the lens of a young paratrooper. It's very personal for me. These debates have names and faces. 3/ When Washington make decisions, young Americans have to follow through. Someone's daughter, son, mother, or father has to do the work and sometimes they don't come home. 4/ We just ended our longest war- one that should have ended long ago. We owe those who gave their lives an honest assessment of how we use our military and its limitations. I'm ready to have that debate. No more blank checks on use of our military- for any administration. 5/ To my fellow combat veterans: politicians will debate and argue about wars, but don't confuse these debates with your individual service. You did your job and served our country when called upon, and for that you should always be proud. I know I'll always be proud of you. END/</em>”</p>
