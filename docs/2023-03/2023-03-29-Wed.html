Bush and President Bill Clinton as their personal videographer. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBrownley/status/1640756153922486272/photo/1">Link to image</a> For several years, she covered historical events at the White House, both domestically and abroad. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBrownley/status/1640756156044902400/photo/1">Link to image</a> In fact, LCDR Garcia was the only videographer covering President Clinton's reception for President Bush, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat, and <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Israel</span>i Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, before the signing of the landmark 1993 Oslo Accords. After leaving active duty, LCDR Garcia became affiliated with the Navy Reserve and received a commission as a Navy Public Affairs Office. She was consistently sought after to record Navy ceremonies and special events. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBrownley/status/1640756159119347719/photo/1">Link to image</a> In 2020, after an exceptional career in the Navy, LCDR Garcia retired and embarked in a career in front of the camera. She is now a versatile actress and singer and earned a degree in Business Administration from CSU Los Angeles and certificate in broadcast journalism from UCLA. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBrownley/status/1640756160851574787/photo/1">Link to image</a> I had the wonderful opportunity to join LCDR Garcia to celebrate her distinguished career in a retirement ceremony in Washington, DC. It was an honor to take part in recognizing her service to our country and wish her “fair winds and following seas.” <a href="https://twitter.com/RepBrownley/status/1640756163246522368/photo/1">Link to image</a></em>”</p>

This is just the first of many hearings and briefings I will hold to ensure the assistance we are providing Ukraine is being used as intended.” “Of the 113 billion dollars appropriated across four supplementals… only 20 percent of the funding is going directly to the Ukrainian government in the form of direct budgetary assistance.” “All funds also are subject to external third-party monitoring by Deloitte. They are conducting randomized spot checks to verify the use of this assistance.” “Today, we have the opportunity to question the independent Inspectors General from the Department of State, USAID, and the Department of Defense. This is the first time all three of you have appeared together before any committee to discuss your oversight role…” “Since day one, as the chairman of this committee, I have been actively exercising my constitutionally guaranteed responsibility to pursue stringent oversight as well. “My first committee meeting was a classified briefing on the U.S. response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And last month, I led a congressional delegation to Ukraine and Poland to conduct in-person oversight of U.S. aid to Ukraine.” “Every dollar counts.”</em>”</p>
