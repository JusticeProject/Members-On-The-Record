Read the highlights from CHM @RepMcCaul's remarks below⬇️ “There is no doubt that the growing aggression of the Chinese Communist Party poses a generational threat to the United States.” “We are living through one of the most dangerous periods in American foreign policy in a generation. It is a struggle for the global balance of power. And the primary battleground is technology leadership. This is an issue Congress – and this administration – cannot ignore.” "Overwhelmingly, BIS continues to grant licenses that allow critical U.S. technology to be sold to our adversaries – even those it's designated as threats to national security. In just one recent 6-month time period, BIS approved licenses worth $60B to Huawei &amp; $40B to SMIC." “I stand ready to work with the administration and Democrats on this panel to strengthen our export controls system where needed. And it's why I launched a 90-day review of BIS.” "We are also falling behind on the ideological battlefield. Congress appropriated $325 million to the @StateDept to counter the CCP's malign influence around the world... Instead, that money was used to fund a bakery in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Tunisia</span> &amp; electric vehicle charging stations in Vietnam." "Every day, we should make sure people around the world know our aid is NOT the debt-trap diplomacy the CCP uses to exploit developing countries. But we are not succeeding. Of the 6.3B people living in developing countries, about 70% have a positive view of China &amp; Russia." “As the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, it is my priority to make sure Congress and this administration are working together – in a bipartisan fashion – to confront this generational threat.” “I look forward to hearing from each of you what you are doing to address the China challenge – and what steps you are taking to dramatically shift your agencies' priorities to meet this challenge head on. From what I have seen over the last two years, much more is needed.” "It's time we move beyond the false belief that the CCP will ever deal in good faith. Time and time again they do not stand behind their commitments. The CCP is acting in their own interest, it's time we start protecting ours."</em>”</p>
