It was emotional to meet these survivors. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1648765756379652107/photo/1">Link to image</a> From there, our weekly Democratic Caucus meeting. This is when Democratic House members discuss the legislative agenda for the week. At 10, the Veterans Affairs Committee. Here, we voted on new legislation and held a hearing on substance use disorder treatment. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1648765759475048454/photo/1">Link to image</a> After that, the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  I asked them to consider the catastrophe at East Palestine in their Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety work, and to improve the FAA's protocols with ground transportation teams at airports. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1648765762234900486/photo/1">Link to image</a> At 11am, I spoke with Warren County Commissioner Shannon Jones — it's important to stay in touch with folks while I'm in DC. Back in my office, we met with multiple veterans' groups. We discussed access to reproductive health care in the military and the VA. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1648765766093733888/photo/1">Link to image</a> After a quick lunch at my desk, I met with Rep. Mike Turner who represents the Dayton area. It's important to us that I build relationships with Republicans in Ohio and beyond. At 1:30pm, we had our first two votes of the day (I'll post recaps soon). I usually go through the tunnels that connect office buildings to the Capitol, but it was a nice day, so I walked outside. I ran out of votes to get to the White House for an event recognizing family caregivers, early educators, and long-term care workers. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1648765771231682562/video/1">Link to video</a> I have been fighting for access to preschool and childcare my entire career, and I was so excited to honor them at the White House today. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1648765774419439616/photo/1">Link to image</a> Raced back to the Hill for a Small Business Committee Hearing where I asked questions on how to best lower taxes for our small businesses. Look for proposed legislation soon. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1648765776768163843/photo/1">Link to image</a> Then we met with Rep. Takano, the Ranking Member for the Veterans Affairs committee. At 5pm, we had another series of votes, so I headed to the floor again. We'll post recaps on these, too. Then we stopped by the Bourbon Caucus (good way to make friends across the aisle), a voter protection event, and the then gave remarks on tax fairness before heading home! <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1648765781633556506/photo/1">Link to image</a></em>”</p>
