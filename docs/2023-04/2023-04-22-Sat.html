Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh face an acute humanitarian crisis: Energy shortages. Medical shortages. Food shortages. Water shortages. The threat of ethnic cleansing. How can the US justify sending any kind of support—security or otherwise—to the regime in Baku? We cannot untether our security assistance from #HumanRights &amp; American values. This not only damages American national security interests, but flies in the face of our duty to honor victims &amp; survivors of the Armenian Genocide, &amp; our duty to ensure history doesn't repeat itself. Let us honor Armenian Genocide victims' &amp; survivors' struggle for survival in the past by standing up for truth today. Let's hold those who would commit genocide to account, even if it takes a lifetime.
