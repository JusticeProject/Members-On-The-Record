A quick recap of what that looks like from your new member of Congress. <a href="https://twitter.com/RepGregLandsman/status/1647991024399032322/photo/1">Link to image</a> For too long, we didn't have the kind of congressional leadership that was focused entirely on improving the lives &amp; communities of people at home.  Every single day, our team is determined to support, lift up, and improve the lives of children and families across Southwest Ohio. In our first 100 days, we've gotten a lot accomplished – but it's just the beginning. As a bipartisan leader, we've voted and cosponsored more than a dozen bipartisan bills and measures &amp; joined the Problem Solvers Caucus - a group of 30 Democrats and 30 Republicans.  We continue to build strong partnerships with folks across political ideologies, in DC &amp; at home. To be highly reliable, we've formed a diverse, regional leadership team to inform and help shape the priorities and work of our office.  We selected 15 local community project funding applications to advance in the process to receive federal funding. As a transparent leader, we've already held five in-person town halls – hearing from hundreds of constituents.  We explain every big vote: where we landed &amp; why.  We've done dozens of site visits and tours, stopping by small businesses, big district employers, schools, and more. And as a fully accountable leader, our team has focused our bills on what matters most to folks at home.  We introduced a bill to cap the cost of insulin for every child. We're working on bills to improve public safety, expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, and renew the Expanded Child Tax Credit. We're getting better and better at supporting folks who reach out for help.  Our office has already resolved more than 300 constituent cases. We work for you. Reach out to us.
