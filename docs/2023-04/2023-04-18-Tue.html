This professor's use of the word “fascism”—in reference to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis—makes me wonder whether he knows what that word means. 3. He can disagree with DeSantis all he wants, but DeSantis is quite the opposite of a fascist. He advocates policies that—whether you love or hate them—seek to decentralize power. Fascism always aims to centralize government and economic power—in ways that often prove violent. 4. Fascism also aims to exalt national interests at the expense of individual rights, often in ways that elevate one race at the expense of others. 5. Merriam-Webster says “fascism” is a philosophy “that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.” 6. The Cambridge Dictionary defines “fascism” as a “political system based on a very powerful leader, state control of social and economic life, and extreme pride in country and race, with no expression of political disagreement.” 7. Where has DeSantis ever advocated for centralized government power? Where has he ever sought government control of the economy or any institution of civil society? Where has he ever supported policies that treat people differently on the basis of race? 8. Where has DeSantis ever tried to exalt collective, national interests at the expense of individual rights? 9. Where has DeSantis ever attempted to exalt federal power at the expense of state and local authority? 10. Bottom line: it's probably better not to use a swastika to promote a protest, especially one that you're trying to promote as “peaceful” and “family friendly.” And it's certainly best not to use the word “fascism” indiscriminately in reference to any viewpoint you dislike. 11. If everything anyone dislikes is fascism, then nothing is. If everyone decided to use “fascism” interchangeably with “I don't like that” or “that's unfair,” it would become far more difficult to identify actual fascism where it makes an appearance. That's dangerous. 12. I have great respect for @UVU and its faculty and admin. I don't know this professor, but I assume he loves our state and country as much as I do. I hope next time he'll choose more accurate words to describe political viewpoints he dislikes. We'd all do well to do the same. 13. Obviously this professor has strong feelings about DeSantis. While I don't share his views, he has every right to express them. He can do that far more effectively by foregoing use of inaccurate (and wildly inappropriate) uses of swastikas or variations of the word “fascism.”</em>”</p>
