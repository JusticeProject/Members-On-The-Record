My bill, the Gasoline Export Ban Act, would temporarily stop the export of gasoline as long as prices are above the average price in 2019. It will allow the U.S. ‚Äì‚Äì not <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span>-led OPEC ‚Äì‚Äì to control the supply of oil produced at home. 2.

Rein in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span> control of oil prices. @SenBlumenthal and I introduced a bill after OPEC's last production cuts to stop arms sales to the <span class="MOTR_Keyword">Saudi</span>s to force MBS to reconsider his efforts to jack up global oil prices.
