Founder of the Afghan Refugees Solidarity Association, 2023 International Woman of Courage Award recipient Zakira Hekmat secretly finished high school under Taliban rule. Through @arsa_org, she continues to promote all refugees' dignity &amp; #HumanRights. <a class="MOTR_Tooltip" href="https://twitter.com/StateDept/status/1635664584173555712?s=20">Link to quoted tweet<span class="MOTR_Tooltiptext">Born in Afghanistan, Zakira Hekmat completed high school secretly under the Taliban's control. In 2014, from a one-room office, she founded the Afghan Refugee Solidarity Association in <span class="MOTR_Keyword">T√ºrkiye</span>, where she has tirelessly advocated for the rights of all refugees and women. #IWOC (Link to twitter.com)</span></a> Journalist Iryna Danylovych promoted transparency in Crimea's health sector before Russia's occupation forces illegally detained her. She suffers from health issues &amp; began a dry hunger strike this month. I join @TLHumanRights as an advocate for her &amp; other Ukrainian journalists. We demand the release of Sue Sha Shinn Thant, who was sentenced to 25 years in jail on trumped up charges &amp; has worked to advance LGBTQI+ rights, hold the Tatmadaw to account &amp; continues to demonstrate powerful commitment to the Burmese people's #HumanRights&amp; democratic future. The women who led the ‚Äúwhite paper" protests against growing authoritarianism in China displayed unwavering bravery in the face of potential violence &amp; reprisal. As Xi Jinping's anti-feminist crackdown intensifies, the women of China have shown they cannot be silenced. Democratic leader Maria Kalesnikava bravely tore up her passport rather than be thrown out of #Belarus by Lukashenka's security forces. The regime unjustly sentenced her to 11 years in prison. We demand her &amp; other prisoners' immediate release. Guatemalan senior prosecutor Virginia Laparra was sentenced to 4 years in jail in retaliation for her work with the International Commission Against Impunity to root out government malfeasance. We call for the release of Laparra &amp; all wrongfully detained prisoners of conscience. .@CPASL's Bhavani Fonseka has pushed for legal &amp; policy advancements to assist victims of atrocities &amp; other #HumanRights abuses in Sri Lanka. Her efforts to combat inequality &amp; discrimination against ethnic &amp; religious minorities continue to pave the way for concrete reforms. As @asia_ajar Co-Founder &amp; Director, Galuh Wandita has critically led efforts to advance #HumanRights throughout Asia, including by strengthening truth commissions in Timor-Leste &amp; Indonesia to promote justice &amp; shed light on the region's brutal past. Jailed nearly 6 years ago on heavily disputed charges, former Philippines Senator @AttyLeiladeLima led an important investigation into extrajudicial killings linked to the Duterte government's violent ‚Äúwar on drugs‚Äù &amp; its blatant disregard for the Filipino people's #HumanRights. Vilma N√∫√±ez de Escorcia‚ÄîPresident of Centro Nicarag√ºense de Derechos Humanos‚Äîhas spent more than 60 years defending #HumanRights in Nicaragua. In support, we must continue to push the regime to restore democratic governance &amp; demand an end to its violent campaign of repression. Environmental activist Nguy Thi Khanh founded the Green Innovation &amp; Development Centre to promote sustainable energy in Vietnam. Persecuted for her advocacy, she was sentenced to 2 years in jail on trumped up charges after opposing coal power expansion. We demand her release. The leadership, fortitude, &amp; resilience of these &amp; many other women &amp; girls continue to make our world a better place. Committed to stand shoulder to shoulder with them as we safeguard democracy &amp; #HumanRights, advance climate protections, &amp; combat inequality. #WomensHistoryMonth</em>‚Äù</p>
